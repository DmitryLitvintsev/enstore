========== volume_clerk.py ====================================================================================

thread safety : make sure that esgdb.SGDb that holds pg connection to database is accesset sequentially by multiple threads. Otherwise volume_clerk suffers instability and reports corrupted results form sg_count table http://www-ccf.fnal.gov/Bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=682 http://uqbar/reviews/r/107 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

library manager incorrectly handled admin priority read and write requests which resulted in: volume dismounts numerous times during scan. If in the request queue there are read and write requests with administrative priority with the same volume family then: If completed request was READ then in some cases there is an attempt to select write request for the bound volume if this volume can not be written it results in skippng this volume and its consequent dismount even if there are pending read requests. (bz #674) 

Library Manager contacted volume clerk for information which is already in the read request ticket when adding request to the queue. Remove this call and get information directly from the ticket. Also few Traces added for better debugging. There also were some KeyErrors that need a better handling and debugging to better identify their causes.
