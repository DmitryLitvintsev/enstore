========== rpm_version ====================================================================================

v2.1.0 release 2 

./helpDesk
./bin
========== tape_aid_wrapper ====================================================================================

Removed cdfen 9310 silo from FCC2. Modified input/output CAPs for FCC2 SL8500 to keep d0en tapes in SL8500-5 and cdfen and stken tapes in SL8500-3. 

./external_distr
========== setups.sh ====================================================================================

call /usr/etc/pnfsSetup to setup pnfs (bugzilla 725) 

./src
========== encp_wrapper.py ====================================================================================

Make the logname and threadname values in Trace.py threadsafe. Migration is known to have an issue, so encp_wrapper and volume_assert_wrapper also are modified. (bugzilla bug #533) 

========== entv.py ====================================================================================

Prevent entv from crashing if a mover is still in the configuration, that no longer exists. (bugzilla #691) 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

after conversation with Mike and Gene removed check for NOSPACE status from line 2049 

check return status of is_vol_available call for NOSPACE http://uqbar/reviews/r/114/ http://www-ccf.fnal.gov/Bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=698 

========== manage_queue.py ====================================================================================

Removing ticket['fc']['external_label'] in manage_queue.py for write requests in the middle of the request selection cycle may cause KeyError exception when request gets pulled from postponed requests queue, because requests in manage_queue.py queue and postponed requests queue are the same references. To fix this allow to remove ticket['fc']['external_label'] from write request only if the request has not yet been processed in the request selection cycle. Note that request selection cycle begins every time when either IDLE or HAVE_BOUND Librray Manager request comes from a mover. (Bugzilla 712) 

========== migrate.py ====================================================================================

Fixed is_duplicated() to have a flag that includes or excludes multiple copy files from consideration. (bugzilla 695, review board 113) 

Improve --restore to handle files migrated from two migrations running simultaneously. (bugzilla #686, review board #109) 

========== operation.py ====================================================================================

Modified make_cap(list) to differentiate between the 3 instances for the output CAP for the 8500F1 library. All d0en drives are now only in SL8500-51 which is ACSLS LSMs 1,4-7, while all cdfen and stken drives and tapes are now only in SL8500-3 which is ACSLS LSMs 1,0-3. Now ejecting these tapes only from their respective CAPS. Changes reviewed by Stan Naymola Apr 15 2010. 

========== pnfs_backup_plotter_module.py ====================================================================================

Don't throw a traceback if there exists a start time but not (yet) a finish time. (Bugzilla #722, RB #128) 

The interval value can optionally display "N days HH:MM:SS" or "1 day HH:MM:SS" instead of just "HH:MM:SS". Handle the formats. (bugzilla #697, review board 115) 

========== scanfiles.py ====================================================================================

Patched to better handle reporting if an unknown file is involved in migration. This should never be able to happen. (Bugzilla #723, Reviewboard #129) 

========== volume_assert_wrapper.py ====================================================================================

Make the logname and threadname values in Trace.py threadsafe. Migration is known to have an issue, so encp_wrapper and volume_assert_wrapper also are modified. (bugzilla bug #533)
