========== lm_director.py ====================================================================================

Do not allow multiple copies for re-directed write request. 
Multiple copies will be done later when files get aggregated and package is written to tape.

========== volume_clerk.py ====================================================================================

get rid of hasattr and getattr calls in inquire_vol. remove function extract_bfid_from_ticket which is part of file_clerk http://uqbar/reviews/r/558/ 

========== migrator.py ====================================================================================

make multiple copy work correctly in SFA Currently each copy of the file on tape has a separate entry in file table in enstore DB. 
The information about duplicates is in duplicates table of enstore db: primary | copy | deleted | pnfs_path. 
If more than one duplicate exists for the same primary the table has more than one same primary. 
For multiple copy in SFA we have a copy for the aggregated file only. 
We suggest to create a record in file table for each file in a package if there is a copy and put it into duplicates. 
In this case a new record in file table will have a bfid of copy of aggregated file as its package_id. 

When processing write list select all possible library tags to use for encp. 
Before the tag was selected from the last file in the list. Also add library tag to original_library to use in the future in make_failed_copies. 
Library tag is not needed in final destination directory, removed the code. RB:http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/553 BZ: 1184
