Encp changes:
=============


Misc.:
======


                      Detailed cvs commit logs


========== manage_queue.py ====================================================================================

1. Addes sg to class Request 2. Added get_sg method 

fixed a typo in sg processing 

added trace 

========== inquisitor_plots.py ====================================================================================

use get instead of indexing 

fix typo caught by bless.py 

========== Trace.py ====================================================================================

added optional thread name to the output of trace 

add fractions of the second to do-print 

========== manage_queue.py ====================================================================================

1. Addes sg to class Request 2. Added get_sg method 

fixed a typo in sg processing 

added trace 

========== e_errors.py ====================================================================================

added definitions for library manager states 

Sometimes Memory Error occurs when reading data from network (memory leak). This was incorrectly interpreted as ENCP_GONE. Now if this occurs mover will dismount a tape and restart itself 

========== mover.py ====================================================================================

if ... statement was in the wron place, which made it not work for null mover type 

1. dump_vars was modified. The output file path now begins with $ENSTORE_OUT. Default path did not change. The output file name has changed to mover_dump-<PID>. The diagnostic now contains the content of /proc/<PID>/status Memory debug flag was added. To enable it define 'memory_debug':1 in the library manager configuration. 2. For a single fm mode compare the self.last_absolute_location to the current absolute location reported by drive before writing as second file mark. If they are not the same error out and put volume to NOACCESS or readonly. 



1. For cern wrapper write 1 fm, write tail, write 2 fms, backspace 1. 2. Single fm option is modoified to write additional fm before unmounting the tape or when switching to read 

Fixed a bug. Was state.name - correct state_name 

========== discipline.py ====================================================================================

make pychecker happy 

make it more thread safe 

reload allowed to write discipline and priority when a new config file is loaded 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

1. If request for a certaiin storage group is in the list of postponed requests skip all requsts for this storage group in the fair_share method. 2. Do not use fair share for bound volume let requsts for this volume proceed even if they exceed fair share. The cost of mounting/dismounting becomes very high in the loaded system, so it is better to finish all requests for a bound volume, rather remount volumes due to fair share restrictions. Fair share will work only for idle requests. This change improves queue processing eliminating a loop through request queue and drastically improving performance. 3. Do not apply discipline to requests for bound volumes. - Another performance impovement. 

to save changes done for CD-LTO3 on stkensrv3 

mdified fair share in process_write_request 

bug fixed 

1. Donot apply discipline to in next_work_this_volume 2. Changed process_write_request. Check this for HIPRI requests!!!!!! 

1. Use state definitios from e_errors 2. If there is only one storage group, return immediately from fairshare 3. Modified processing of restricted host access 4. Better structure of next_work_any_volume 5. Better structure of next_work_this_volume 

enhanced request processing for disk movers 

remove the mover from works_at_movers when removing from volumes_at_movers 

========== udp_server.py ====================================================================================

Added the function get_server_address(). 

make it more thread safe 

Typos fixed from previous commit. 

========== tab_flipping_nanny.py ====================================================================================

--auto also take library into consideration 

add -a; --auto awitch that would figure out default output ifile from configuration 

========== enstore_functions3.py ====================================================================================

Added functions is_volume_disk() and is_volume_tape(). 

Initial commit with the is_bfid(), is_volume(), is_location_cookie_tape(), is_location_cookie_disk(), is_location_cookie(), extract_brand() and extract_file_number() functions. 

========== option.py ====================================================================================

Added --read-to-end-of-tape to "get". 

Include a way for processes like encp to state the logging of thread names via their Interface class. 

========== aci.py ====================================================================================

reverted to 1.9 

added release-notes dir 

If an error occured talking to the AML2, then supply a little extra logic for aci_qvolsrange() to handle the missing x[2] field. Without this fix tracebacks would occur. If x[2:] is not there, then the empty list is returned in its place. 

========== e_errors.py ====================================================================================

added definitions for library manager states 

Sometimes Memory Error occurs when reading data from network (memory leak). This was incorrectly interpreted as ENCP_GONE. Now if this occurs mover will dismount a tape and restart itself 

========== encp.py ====================================================================================

Cleanup code. Use constants for Trace.message() calls mostly. 

Added support for reading the input from standard in. It is supported on systems that have the /dev/fd/ file system. 

Cleaned up the get and encp code. This made for an easier creation of put.py. 

More scrubing between encp.py and get.py. Also, started work on the writing parts for the future put command. 

Modified encp and get to reduce the amount of duplicate code the two have. 

Minor code cleanup between encp.py and get. Some get specific things were removed from encp.py (and moved to get.py). 

Just some code cleanup. Nothing functional changed. 

1) Use enstore_functions3 module functions instead of local ones. 2) Modified verify_read_request_consistancy() to include checking the CRC and size in layer 2 *before* doing the transfer. Previously, it was only checked *after* the transfer which wasted resources if there was a mismatch. 

Added more debug logging for each seperate CRC comparison/check. Previously, only one was done that included all the various CRC checks. 

========== ratekeeper.py ====================================================================================

Include the timezone when inserting items into the accounting DB. This is so that daylight to/from standard time changes don't cause problems. 

Cleanup acc_daily_summary() and filler() functionality in accounting_server and update_DRVBusy() and update_slots() in ratekeeper. These changes have forks to execute the updates to avoid pauses to requests. 

========== scanfiles.py ====================================================================================

Corrected the crc checks of layer 2. 

Added a comparision check of the CRC and length values in layer 2 with the values stored in the Enstore DB. 

========== mover.py ====================================================================================

if ... statement was in the wron place, which made it not work for null mover type 

1. dump_vars was modified. The output file path now begins with $ENSTORE_OUT. Default path did not change. The output file name has changed to mover_dump-<PID>.

If they are not the same error out and put volume to NOACCESS or readonly. 



1. For cern wrapper write 1 fm, write tail, write 2 fms, backspace 1. 2. Single fm option is modoified to write additional fm before unmounting the tape or when switching to read 

Fixed a bug. Was state.name - correct state_name 

========== discipline.py ====================================================================================

make pychecker happy 

make it more thread safe 

reload allowed to write discipline and priority when a new config file is loaded 

========== udp_client.py ====================================================================================

Added get_address() as a useful debugging function. 

Catch SyntaxErrors and TypeErrors from en_val.r_eval(). 

========== delete_at_exit.py ====================================================================================

Fix one more possible false warning message in encp about the pnfs_agent key being missing. 

Catch sys.stderr.write() errors. 

========== pnfs.py ====================================================================================

Spelling correction in comments. (perpouses => purposes) 

Fixed things found during admin guide writing. 1) Removed --volume. It was still in the help (it used to list volmap info). 2) Fixed the Tag class instantiation (self.dir vs. self.directory). 

add get_abs_pnfs_path() 

========== get.py ====================================================================================

Cleanup code. Use constants for Trace.message() calls mostly. 

Cleaned up the get and encp code. This made for an easier creation of put.py.

add migration_summary 

change 'unknown' cluster to the node name
