    Set mtx timeout from media changer.
    
    MTX scsi Linux timeout was hardcoded to be 5 min.
    This is not enough due to statement from IBM developers and should be 16 min.
    Implemented variable mtx timeout in mtx code (not in this review).
    In this patch.
    1. Implemented setting of mtx scsi linux timeout from mtx media changer.
    2. Implemented error processing for mtx: Request Sense: Sense Key=Not Ready.
    3. Implemented update_db for the MTXN_MediaLoader in do_retry.
    4. Changed retry loop in mtx_mount, mtx_dismount of MTXN_MediaLoader class.

    [migration] BZ:2051 RB:586 force migrating duplicated volume
    
    migration blocks migrating files in migrated or duplicated state.
    This may have sense if someone tries to migrate tape recently migrated.
    In BZ 2051 migration does not migrate tape duplicated five years ago.
    
    Add --force option to bypass this check.
    This is few liner change; the rest of the changes are reformatting.

    Improve mtx command timeout processing.
    
    It was observed that even the mount / dismount command timeouts it actually get executed.
    Request database inventory to check if the tape operation was done and retry if it was not.
    The database inventory adds about 40s, but it is more reliable to just check if tape was mounted / dismounted rather, than repeat command.
    Repetition of the completed command may confise TS4500 firmware as recently observed.
