========== alarm.py ====================================================================================

remove rexec dependency 

========== manage_queue.py ====================================================================================

Added a log message to reinit() saying that it is reconfiguring itself after being notified by the configuration server there is a new configuration. 

========== configuration_client.py ====================================================================================

Support the new --print switch for the configuration client. 

removed extra print that broke tools/service_ips 

Added support for --file-fallback in the configuration client. This switch alters the use of --show to read from the local copy of the configuration file (if present), when the configuration server is down. 

more logick added to get_config_dict 

added get_config_dict to get config dict ether from config server or from config file in case when server does not respond

========== pnfs_backup_plot.py ====================================================================================

copy data from pnfs server and then plot. Still partially hardcoded 

========== enstore_overall_status.py ====================================================================================

Added --html-dir and --config-hosts switches. 

Fixed this to obtain the known_config_servers section of the default configuration. The loop over it to find the configuration server list to obtain each systems status. Then make the web page using this information (this part didn't change). 

temporary fix for d0en, remove hardcoded values 

put into prodiuction local changes 

change red ball to question mark for communication timeout

========== aci.py ====================================================================================

Fixed aci wrapper to build with swig 1.3 

========== recent_file_listing.py ====================================================================================

delay creating *.old to the last second 

Made SDE ready. 

========== aml2.py ====================================================================================

Fixed aci wrapper to build with swig 1.3 

========== dispatching_worker.py ====================================================================================

added reset_interval method 

========== encp.py ====================================================================================

bumping version to v3_7 because of encpCut 

Allow FQDN in the disk volume labels. For charset, hostnamecharset is now defined. 

On Solaris 10 /tmp is a swap partition. os.pathconf(PC_FILESIZEBITS) returns -1 instead of the number of bits. In this case use 32 for the number of bits that can store the size of a file. 

Include the user_level (ADMIN, USER or USER2) in the tickets for possible future use. 

Fixed the bug in encp that was preventing the RESUBMITS count from being incremented correctly. 

When --get-bfid and --override-deleted are test filename to be longer than 0. 

When sending an original request (with more copies to follow) update the work_ticket to include the number of copies still to come. 

Modified the "encp aborted from" output to include more info. 

The patch fixes a bug if --get-bfid matches to to many files for the pnfsid. It uses the bfid in layer 1 to determine which one it really wants. 

Use getattr(errno, 'EFSCORRUPTED', errno.EIO) instead of errno.EFSCORRUPTED to avoid pychecker warnings. Added a check in librarysize_check() to check the result of the returned library info from the config server. Currently, goes stait into pulling out data, when the error saying the library does not exist is ignored. 

========== ratekeeper.py ====================================================================================

Cleanup acc_daily_summary() and filler() functionality in accounting_server and update_DRVBusy() and update_slots() in ratekeeper. These changes have forks to execute the updates to avoid pauses to requests. 

========== enstore_html.py ====================================================================================

workaround to make lint happy. list[::N] does not pass our lint but is perfectly legal 

cast to list to make link happy 

sort encp list in reverse order 

fixed path to log files 

fixed getting configuration ether from config server of from config file 

debugging issues on ccfsrv2 

get html directory from config server 

modify location of log files 

bug fixed 

WARNING I changed "cgi-bin/enstore" to "cgi-bin" 

remove rexec dependency 

========== scanfiles.py ====================================================================================

handle duplicate location errors better 

Remove skipping of "volmap", ".A" and ".B" files or directories. 

Add an age specifier to duplicate location. Also, fixed a missing layer 1 error. 

Address duplicate location errors with one of the files marked deleted. 

If a location is duplicated and the tape is in a shelf library, then the information is not flagged as an error. 

If one of the files flagged for a "duplicate location" is deleted, consider it a warning, not an error. 

Handle the case where a reverse scan finds a file without layer 1, but does have layer 4. 

Fixed a problem with handling some orphan files. Also, ignored some false errors if a user creates multiple hardlinks to a file, then deletes the original. 

========== mover.py ====================================================================================

additional check for eod cookie 

Include a patch for DiskMover (Mover already has it) to pass along the number of copies to follow. 

set mover to offline state with tape in it if set_volume_no_access has failed. 

Set volume to NOACCESS and generate alarm if set_remaining_bytes failed. 

fixed a bug in read_tape 

bug fixed 

fixed crc processing for disk mover reads 

fixed bug 

in disk mover if data directory does not exist create it 

increase LM poll interval 3 times if not in IDLE or HAVE_BOUND 

Raise an alarm if the write tab status reported by the drive does not match the write tab status recorded in the volume DB. 

========== plotter_main.py ====================================================================================

make sure we delete pts files 

make module that does ratekeeper active 

fix typo 

fix typo 

make sure we close connection to the database 

re-implemented mounts plot so it shows all libraries (non null media type) 

========== callback.py ====================================================================================

We need to catch IOError or OSError incase the open of /proc/net/tcp fails. On 9-10-2007, an encp gave a traceback opening /proc/net/tcp because of "No such file or directory". How that can happen to a file in /proc, I don't know. 

remove rexec dependency 

========== movcmd_mc.py ====================================================================================

remove rexec dependency 

========== media_changer_client.py ====================================================================================

Fixed aci wrapper to build with swig 1.3

========== volume_clerk_client.py ====================================================================================

remove rexec dependency 

========== charset.py ====================================================================================

Allow FQDN in the disk volume labels. For charset, hostnamecharset is now defined. 

========== mover-nanny.py ====================================================================================

1. do not restart or reboot movers by default. 2. do not check null movers by default. 

remove rexec dependency 

========== plotter.py ====================================================================================

fix typo

added some queries for encp transfers and encp errors 

Fixed syntax error from prvious commit. 

Cleanup acc_daily_summary() and filler() functionality in accounting_server and update_DRVBusy() and update_slots() in ratekeeper. These changes have forks to execute the updates to avoid pauses to requests.

if mover in wam_queue is None do not process it 

========== enstore_file_listing_cgi.py ====================================================================================

remove hard coded path 

========== file_clerk_client.py ====================================================================================

remove rexec dependency 

These changes allow for --erase to be usable for the file clerk client. Support for hidden options now exist in option.py. --erase for the "enstore file" command is now a hidden option. This means that it is not shone in the --help or --usage output and is avaliable only to adminstrators. Currently, the code has the constant ALLOW_ERASE set to false, to enable this command this constant only needs to be set to true. 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

bug fixed 

apply some conditions before calling restrict_host_access in next_work_this volume 

For bound volumes allow requests for machines that exceed the number of ongoing transfers. For this the max_permitted argument in restrict_host_access and the coppersponding arg in the discipline section of configuration dictionary can be set a tuple (n1,n2,n3) where n1 - as before max permitted n2 - add this for bound volume for read requests n3 - add this for bound volume for write requests 

back to not considerng SG for exceeded limits. It has proven to improve the performance 

set lock state from configuration on reinit 

reload LM configuration dictionary in reinit 

reload LM configuration dictionary in reinit

typo fixed 

In next_work_this_volume if the number of requests exceedded the SG limit, do not consider requests for this SG 

bugs fixed 

timing added 

check for how long the mover is in its state and generate alarm if time is expired 

keep the local list of write volumes to not send excess requests to volume clerk 

buf fixed 

fixed the problem exposed at cdf. In this_volume cycles through the samee requests near "BBB". Fixed by breaking if the same request was already processed.
