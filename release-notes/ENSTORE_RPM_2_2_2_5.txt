========== backup ====================================================================================

http://uqbar/reviews/r/381/ 
I have conducted a study of stkensrv0n behavior during volume_clerk timeouts: 
https://srm.fnal.gov/twiki/bin/view/EnstoreCorner/VolumeClerkTimeouts 
Apparently during accounting db backup activity we see system swapping and queries on enstoredb slowing. 
It happens that in the period between midnight and 3:00 AM the activity on enstoredb is particularly heavy. 
Running accounting db backup during this time compounds the problem. This patch moves the accounting db backup to 5:10 AM time slot. 

========== summary_plots ====================================================================================

rename "make_overall_plot" cron to "summary_overall_plot". 
We already have cron "make_overall_plot", so it was confusing ecron. http://uqbar/reviews/r/380/ 

========== tab_flip_watch_cdfen ====================================================================================

Added CDF-10KCGS and CDF-10KCF1 libraries to tab flipping per REQ 18610 and RITM 14308. 

========== tab_flip_watch_stken ====================================================================================

Removed tab flipping for CD-LTO3GS as the library has been decommissioned. 

./databases/control_files
========== pg_hba.conf-stken-enstoredb ====================================================================================

added migration nodes by full IP for write enable access 

./src
========== atomic.py ====================================================================================

1) The os.path.isdir(), os.path.islink(), etc. functions call os.stat() which needs to be wrapped with file_utils.wrapper(). 
2) Writes using --put-cache and --shortcut have had a patch to get the full path to PNFS files to send to the mover 
to avoid the mover's no NULL in path error. This patch generalizes this feature for reads too. 
3) Another source of cyclic paths in PNFS has been found. 
4) When --get-bfid and --skip-bfid are used together, honor the skip pnfs part. (bugzillas 1039, 1043, 1044 and 1045; review board 347) 

========== chimera.py ====================================================================================

fix logic of consistent() method 

replace traceback.print_tb() call with Trace.handle_error() http://uqbar/reviews/r/425/ 

BUG FIX: encp fails to work with chimera on files imported from pnfs as the decsion what class 
to instantiate is made based on examination of pnfsid. This patch fixes the issue. 
http://uqbar/reviews/r/409/ http://www-ccf.fnal.gov/Bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1083 

Handle the situation where the user is using a path containing a symbolic link to the Chimera mountpoint. 
Also, added self. to one line in plibrary(). 

1) The os.path.isdir(), os.path.islink(), etc. functions call os.stat() which needs to be wrapped with file_utils.wrapper(). 
2) Writes using --put-cache and --shortcut have had a patch to get the full path to PNFS files to send to the mover to 
avoid the mover's no NULL in path error. This patch generalizes this feature for reads too. 
3) Another source of cyclic paths in PNFS has been found. 
4) When --get-bfid and --skip-bfid are used together, honor the skip pnfs part. (bugzillas 1039, 1043, 1044 and 1045; review board 347) 

Allow the --mount-point switch to be usable by dCache instead of just by an administrative user. This will be used by encp_test_script. 

========== cleanUDP.py ====================================================================================

Allow UDP packet fragmentation. It is disallowed by default. If it is disallowed then the following problem occurs. 
If UDP packet size is less than MTU on a sender node and bigger than MTU on receiver 
node the packet gets delivered without fragmentation and rejected on receiver node because 
it can not treat frames bigger than MTU. This was observed when deploying new CMS worker nodes with 10Gb intrefaces. (bz 1065). 

========== delete_at_exit.py ====================================================================================

1) The os.path.isdir(), os.path.islink(), etc. functions call os.stat() which needs to be wrapped with file_utils.wrapper(). 
2) Writes using --put-cache and --shortcut have had a patch to get the full path to PNFS files to send to 
the mover to avoid the mover's no NULL in path error. This patch generalizes this feature for reads too. 
3) Another source of cyclic paths in PNFS has been found. 
4) When --get-bfid and --skip-bfid are used together, honor the skip pnfs part. (bugzillas 1039, 1043, 1044 and 1045; review board 347) 

========== delfile_chimera.py ====================================================================================

discovered that just opening file in chimera on write or writing an empty string to it does not 
change file content. Write "\n" instead (mimicking echo "" > file) 
This case then handled in delfile_chimera to not to mark files deleted on destination tape. 
Otherwise files on destination tape get marked deleted by delfile_chimera http://uqbar/reviews/r/436/ 

========== duplicate.py ====================================================================================

Implemented the duplication cleanup_after_scan() function. Previously, it was a no-op. (bugzilla #973, review board #289) 

========== edb.py ====================================================================================

print active_files, deleted_files, unknown_files, active_bytes, deleted_bytes,unknown_bytes 
by "enstore vol --gvol <VOLUME>" command http://uqbar/reviews/r/369/ and limit 
max number of idle connections to 5 to avoid unnecessary memory consumption on stkensrv0n http://uqbar/reviews/r/379/ 

========== encp.py ====================================================================================

bump version of encp to v3_10e http://uqbar/reviews/r/444/ 

bumping version to v3_10d because of encpCut 

1) The os.path.isdir(), os.path.islink(), etc. functions call os.stat() which needs to be wrapped with file_utils.wrapper().

protect access to intf.directory with hasattr(intf,"directory") check. http://uqbar/reviews/r/376 

Handle the situation where the user is using a path containing a symbolic link to the PNFS mountpoint. Also, convert the PNFS id from a hex string to integer, instead of trying it as a decimal string. 

1) The os.path.isdir(), os.path.islink(), etc. functions call os.stat() which needs to be wrapped with file_utils.wrapper().

========== volume_clerk.py ====================================================================================

reset deleted_files and deleted_bytes on volume recycle http://uqbar/reviews/r/404/ 

./tools
========== encp_test_functions ====================================================================================

Added test of encp with --get-bfid and --skip-pnfs. 
It is not enabled by default, due to its requirement of no PNFS or Chimera mount points mounted. (bugzilla #1068, review board #370) 

1) On cleanup, remove the lock file last. 
2) Send the test header and trailer info to the $ENCP_OUTPUT file. 
3) Prevent multiple /tmp/enstore.conf tests from clobbering each other. 
4) Run "enstore scan" after write tests to verify the metadata. 5) If an encp fails 
due to CONFIGDEAD or SERVERDIED errors, the encp is retried up to 10 times, in the 
hope that the situation is temporary. 6) Improved stability when running tests using Chimera. (bugzilla #1060, review board #363) 

========== encp_test_script ====================================================================================

========== fix_tag_inheritance.sh ====================================================================================

The repair_tag() function has had the guts of its logic split into three functions: repair_tag(), repair_tag_parent_id() and repair_inheritance(), where the new repair_tag() will call the other two. This allows for the elif that covers the case not implemented to reuse the functionality already there. 

========== pnfs_db_restore.py ====================================================================================

create file /etc/sysconfig/pgsql/postgresql and put location of pnfs database there 

./doc/WWW
