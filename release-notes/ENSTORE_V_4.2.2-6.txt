        Enhancement: New view of DRAINING state.
        As it was mentioned before DRAINING mover state is actually not a state.
        As a consequence on entv it was rewritten by active transfer and the
        visual information was lost.
        This patch shows draining state as a circle with a pointing down
        arrow. (See attachment in bugzilla).

        DRAINING mover state is actually ACTIVE but tell mover to go offline
        after it finishes the last transfer if it received offline command
        during transfer. So it is an internal state and does not need to get
        reported and does not require any special treatment externally.
