========== enstore_display.py ====================================================================================

Changes from comments made by Sasha in regard to bugzilla #916 (review board #249). 

Bug 916 - BUG FIX: Don't restart entire process; NEW FEATURE: Allow for users to choose libraries. 

========== entv.py ====================================================================================

Changes from comments made by Sasha in regard to bugzilla #916 (review board #249). 

Bug 916 - BUG FIX: Don't restart entire process; NEW FEATURE: Allow for users to choose libraries. 

========== histogram.py ====================================================================================

make sure variance is never negative which was happening for large numbers. http://uqbar/reviews/r/244/ http://www-ccf.fnal.gov/Bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=901 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

1. Put complete volume in fo into write request in work_at_movers. (bz 919) 2. It has been noticed that admin priority write request processing violates file It has been noticed that admin priority write request processing violates file family width restriction in the following scenario. 1. Regular priority request completed and mover has returned HAVE_BOUND. File family - FF1 2. Request with admin priority gets pocked up for processing. File family - FF2 3. There is (are) movers in HAVE_BOUND state for FF2 and file family with is equal to the number of such movers. This should not allow selected request to go to the current mover. 4. But due to bug the request goes to the current mover. This happens not so oftten because there must be movers waiting in HAVE_BOUND state for FF2. This can only happen when there were no write requests for FF2 (bz 918) 

========== migrate.py ====================================================================================

Loop over the correct list of files in _make_copies(). (bugzilla #905, review board #245) 

========== rawUDP_p.py ====================================================================================

define ret and and request_id so that they exist if exception occurs.(bz 917) 

========== rawUDP.py ====================================================================================

define ret and and request_id so that they exist if exception occurs.(bz 917) 

========== take_out_acsls.sh ====================================================================================

Changes for transferring tapes to new robots. 1. Added output of group number to stdout as this is needed for the script used when the tapes are entered into the new robot. (it inputs the same tapes that were ejected so need the group number that has all that info). 2. Added a WARNING when a tape already has a system_inhibit_0. The warning is output to stdout and log file containging the vsn, the state and the comment. This info enables the user to reset tapes that were inhibited for reasons other than the transfer. Changes tested on stken for both xfer and shelve actions.

========== cdf.conf ====================================================================================

changed device name for cdfenmvr175a -TAM 

========== sam.conf ====================================================================================

Set D0-LTO4GS.library_manager, SL8500GS.media_changer and movers LTO4_009, LTO4_010, LTO4_011, LTO4_012, LTO4_016, LTO4_017, LTO4_018 and LTO4_019 to active monitoring. Movers LTO4_013, LTO4_014, and LTO4_015 remain non monitored pending drive installs and they need to have their /dev/rmt paths verified once enstore is installed on them. 

Changed /dev/rmt/ paths for enmvr009 thru enmvr019 to correct values after enstore installed on them. Note, movers 012 thru 015 do not yet have drives, but these were also changed to the tps4d0n value as that is what 7 out of 8 of the 8 that have drives are named. Thus if when those drives are added, they might also have these values. Device names for movers with tape drives attached: enmvr009= tps1d0n enmvr010= tps4d0n enmvr011= tps4d0n enmvr012= tps4d0n enmvr016= tps4d0n enmvr017= tps4d0n enmvr018= tps4d0n enmvr019= tps4d0n Also set these 3 to tps4d0n -- do not yet have drives but might have these values: enmvr013 enmvr014 enmvr015 

Moved SL8500GS.media_changer and D0-LTO4GS.library_manager to run on d0ensrv5n. Uncommented lines which set library_manager_host_1 and media_changer_host_1 as these were already set to d0ensrv5n, and used these as target hosts. 

changed device name for d0enmvr157a -TAM 

Changes per CRQ000000000609, move 1 as they apply to d0en: 1. Commented out 4 drives being reallocated, LTO4_19,29,52,132 2. Add the new SL8500-6 LM, MC, and movers: D0-LTO4GS.library_manager SL8500GS.media_changer LTO4_009.mover LTO4_010.mover LTO4_011.mover LTO4_012.mover LTO4_013.mover LTO4_014.mover LTO4_015.mover LTO4_016.mover LTO4_017.mover LTO4_018.mover LTO4_019.mover These are all being added with these extra parameters to keep them from alarming until the drives are moved/renamed/installed: 'noupdown':'jsh', 'inq_ignore':'jsh', Changes OK'd by Sasha. 

========== stk.conf ====================================================================================

changed device name for LTO4_111, commented out LTO4_102,104,112,115 --TAM 

Commented out the Powderhorns in the Mezzanine from 'www_server' media per discussion with Sasha. 

Retired 9310 silos, deconfigured: 9940.library_manager CD-9940B.library_manager TST-9940B.library_manager stk.media_changer 9940B27.mover 9940B32.mover 9940B33.mover 9940B34.mover 9940B35.mover 9940B36.mover 9940B41.mover null1.library_manager null1.media_changer null13.mover (stkenmvr13a) null14.mover (stkenmvr14a) Changed configdict['crontabs'] for stk.media_changer to SL8500G1.media_changer.
