========== rpm_version ====================================================================================

version 3.0.0 release 3 

./src
========== encp.py ====================================================================================

fix typo http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/582/ 

send copy of the ticket to library manager director http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/582/ 

"--volume" option was declared as USER. Need "--skip-deleted-files" to go along with it. 
Also made "skip-pnfs" and "get-bfid" ADMIN options (they were hidden before) http://uqbar/reviews/r/579/ 

1) make --volume option user level option 
2) fix indentation issue with library manager client invocation 
3) change version to v3_11a http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/577/ 

========== enstore_constants.py ====================================================================================

========== enstore_system_html.py ====================================================================================

Fix html link to "Production System's Overall Status" (bz 1222) 

========== file_clerk.py ====================================================================================

Provide an option to list either all files (including package members) or just files written to the tape: 
regular or packages. This is needed by assert_volume in mover code. The default behaviour was not changed. (bz 1224). 

========== info_client.py ====================================================================================

Raises Exception instead of str. (Bug 1225) 

Provide an option to list either all files (including package members) or just files written to the tape: regular or packages. 
This is needed by assert_volume in mover code. The default behaviour was not changed. (bz 1224). 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

Put volume assert requests into prioritized read / write request queue in a library manager. 
For this fake volume assert request as read_from_hsm request. Add a new field to request ticket: ticket['work_in_work'] = 'volume_assert'. bz 1126. 

Due to congested network traffic sometimes messages sent from a mover to the library manager can come re-syncronized. Consider the folloving scenario: 
1. Mover sends IDLE request to LM 
2. LM gets the message, and sends work to the mover. 
3. Mover does not get LM work and for TIMEOUT period and re-tries IDLE request. 
4. Mover receives LM message, sent in (2) and starts work, but 
5. LM recieves re-tried message (3) 
6. Library manager compares uniquie ids in work at movers and receved from the mover and if they are the same, 
does not send new work to mover (backed out request). This scenario is resolved the same way in mover_idle 
and mover_bound_volume. If this happens first in mover_bound and then the same id is sent by IDLE mover request, 
mover idle requests get rejected due to backed out request. To get out of this state consider mover 
idle after 60 s. This is log enough to eventually get a "trusted" request. 

This has been found during disk movers testing. Library manager was giving out write requests for NOACCESS bound volumes. 
In next_work_this volume return immediately if volume system inhibit is set to NOACCESS or NOT_ALLOWED (bz 1216, rb http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/575) 

========== migration_summary_plotter_module.py ====================================================================================

fixed percent calculation to float 

CVSee http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/576/ : ------------------------------------------



========== mover.py ====================================================================================

It appears that the fix for "Too long in state.." (bz1200) worked for write requests only. 
Additional changes are done for read requests. 

Put volume assert requests into prioritized read / write request queue in a library manager. 
For this fake volume assert request as read_from_hsm request. 
Add a new field to request ticket: ticket['work_in_work'] = 'volume_assert'. bz 1126. 

Reset self.time_in_state, self.in_state_to_cnt, and self.__dict__['state_change_time'] only when state changes. (bz 1219). 

Set volume "full" if its remaining is remaining_factor*capacity. Make remaining_factor configurable with default value of 0.01 (1%). (bz 1215) 

========== plotter_main.py ====================================================================================

NEW FEATURE: SFA Statistics plot web page. Plot SFA statistics and group plots on a separate web page. (bz 1223) 

========== volume_assert.py ====================================================================================

Put volume assert requests into prioritized read / write request queue in a library manager. 
For this fake volume assert request as read_from_hsm request. Add a new field to request ticket: ticket['work_in_work'] = 'volume_assert'. bz 1126. 

========== volume_clerk.py ====================================================================================

handle eod cookie taking into account volume media http://uqbar.fnal.gov/reviews/r/578/ 

palliative development to handle situation when volume_clerk encounters request to set eod_cookie 
which is less or equal eod_cookie stored in DB http://uqbar/reviews/r/573/ 

./src/cache/servers
========== migrator.py ====================================================================================

BUG FIX: change file family wrapper depending on the file size. If file family wrapper for aggregated file is 
cpio_odc and file size is > maximal size of cpio_odc wrapped file, set wrapper to cern. (bz 1228).
