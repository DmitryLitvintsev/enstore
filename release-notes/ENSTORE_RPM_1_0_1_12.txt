========== duplication_util.py ====================================================================================

Replaced calls to pnfs.Pnfs.get_path() with those to find_pnfs_file.find_pnfsid_path(). 

========== library_manager_client.py ====================================================================================

Changed the incorrect "media changer" label to "library manager". 

========== encp_wrapper.py ====================================================================================

Support passing any error messages up to the migration. 

Set the encp interface value migration_or_duplication to true. This will allow for some checks to be skipped that the migration has already done. 

========== mover.py ====================================================================================

Fixed bugzilla bug 75. It was not fixed in tye previous version as stated 

Fixed bugzilla bug 75. Do not write fm if last operation was "read" and the new is "write" for the new volume - HIPRI request. 

type fixed 

more diagnostics added 

include fm writing time into drive time 

added diagnostic message to debug bug 75 in bugzilla 

modified default timeouts in LM and mover to synchronize them. Bugzilla bug 76 

Fixed a bug reported as bugzilla bug #72. There were not enough arguments in the diagnostic message and thread was crashing. 

force set null wrapper for disk mover 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================

modified default timeouts in LM and mover to synchronize them. Bugzilla bug 76 

corrected the indentation in mover_error 

always update lm part of the ticket so that if lm address changes it gets midified in the ticket 

========== duplicate.py ====================================================================================

Made the duplication compatible with the migration code again. 

========== enstore_functions3.py ====================================================================================

Added strip_brand() function that returns the opposite information that extrace_brand() does. 

========== migrate.py ====================================================================================

Enabled --threading to be passed to encp. Get error messages from encp now that encp.py and encp_wrapper.py support doing so. Made compatibilty (and code cleanup) changes between migration and duplication. 

For restored volumes, call vcc.touch() so inventory updates this volume. 

Make restarted migration handle swapping after being interupted while swapping. 

Fixed --scan-volumes to scan more than one volume at a time. A return statement was in the wrong place. 

Made a number of improvments in performace. Replaced pnfs.Pnfs.get_path() calls with find_pnfs_file.find_pnfsid_path() calls. Attempts to reduce the number of db and pnfs queries. 

========== encp.py ====================================================================================

Fixed encp working with the pnfs_agent. 

Support passing any error messages up to the migration. 

Modify do_work() so that it can be used from encp_wrapper.py instead of main(). 

========== pnfs_agent.py ====================================================================================

Added readlayer() and writelayer() functions. 

========== scanfiles.py ====================================================================================

It is no longer an error when the file DB record for a file has the deleted status as yes or unknown with no pnfsid recorded. 

Handle duplicate file locations on a tape. It shouldn't traceback. 

Pulled out the functionality that went into find_pnfs_file.py function find_pnfsid_path(). Now call the new find_pnfsid_path() function. 

========== mover.py ====================================================================================

Fixed bugzilla bug 75. It was not fixed in tye previous version as stated 

Fixed bugzilla bug 75. Do not write fm if last operation was "read" and the new is "write" for the new volume - HIPRI request.

========== delete_at_exit.py ====================================================================================

Made delete_at_exit.py threadsafe so that do_work() of encp.py instead of main() of encp.py can be used in migration. 

========== enstore_constants.py ====================================================================================

Added RATE_* constants similar to the capacity constants for various media types. 

========== pnfs.py ====================================================================================

Removed check_size(). 

The --tags command was failing when the user passed the target directory on the command line. The readtag() function was missing the directory argument. It now works. 

Added functions: check_size get_enstore_canonical_path get_enstore_fs_path get_enstore_pnfs_path get_enstore_mount_point get_enstore_admin_mount_point get_last_db set_last_db get_pnfsid get_layer_4 get_layer_2 get_layer_1 get_layer get_database layer_file id_file parent_file access_file database_file 

========== library_manager.py ====================================================================================
