./bin
========== tape_aid_wrapper ====================================================================================

./crontabs
========== tab_flip_watch_cdfen ====================================================================================

Added tab flipping ecrons for 8500GS robot and removed those no longer existing in 8500G1 robot. 

========== tab_flip_watch_d0en ====================================================================================

./src
========== chimera.py ====================================================================================

Improved the perfomance of encp, migration and metadata scanning. (bugzilla #931, review board #262) This includes: 
1) fewer PNFS/Chimera accesses seting file sizes for long filename files 
2) handling PNFS databases that have multiple entry points 
3) not hanging SLF4 kernels with paths like /pnfs/fs/usr/Migration/.(access)(000000000000000000001080)/Migration/.(get)(database) 
4) processing the list of current mountpoints once (namespace.py) instead of twice, once for PNFS and once for Chimera. 
5) cache found PNFS database starting directories and their associated .(get)(database) values 
6) retrying ESTALE errors, since PNFS has been found to be inconsistant 

========== encp.py ====================================================================================

Include useful information in the LM receive error message of encp. (bugzilla #939, review board #267)
