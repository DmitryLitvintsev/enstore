                        ENCP release notes, from v2_18 to v2_19


Encp changes:
=============

Encps on 64bit alpha (OSF1) will now work.  Previous version had a problem
converting 64bit unsigned longs to 32bit unsigned ints. 

Moved a corrupted filesystem check that listed the entire contents of a 
directory.  This particular check is now only done if an error occurs first.
For directories with large number of files this was a large performance hit.

Encp now checks the input files filesize on reads against the recorded
filesize.  This is to catch files with zero length in pnfs but have
been successfully written to tape without any other errors.

Numerous log file messages were changed and/or added.  Most improve the use 
of the unique id as search string when reading the log files manually.

When using encp via dcache files and directories can now have the name "root".

In the log file vendor was spelled venor.  This is now corrected.


Misc.:
======

There is a program called ecrc that will calculate the CRC for a local file.

========== ./modules/.cvsignore ====================================================================================

ignore ecrc binary 

========== ./modules/EXfer.c ====================================================================================

On alpha machines we need to be careful about using unsigned longs. They are actuall 64bit sized values. Which doesn't always play nice when coercing down to 32bits. Since, we only need 32bits for the adler32 algorithm just use unsigned integer. 

The 64 bit unsigned long size problem is now fixed for the threaded version of this code. 

Changed the crc variable from an unsigned long to unsigned int. On true64 bit machines where the long was 8 bytes this created a conversion error to 32 bits. This should work since all supported platforms define unsigned int to be 4 bytes. However, that is not going to necessarily remain true. C99 defines a header file called stdint.h that defines various int types. One of them is uint32_t. Unfortunatly, only Linux 6x and 7x have this header file. It might be a while until other platforms have releases with this functionality.

========== ./src/alarm.py ====================================================================================

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

========== ./src/atomic.py ====================================================================================

Moved the filesystem is currputed test from encp.py to here to remove a listdir for each transfer. Also, fixed the way default errnos are determined. 

Better error detection for file creation problems. 

========== ./src/delete_at_exit.py ====================================================================================

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

========== ./src/e_errors.py ====================================================================================

Fixed a bug in is_ok(). 

Added various is_XXX() functions. These test for retriable, non-retriable, alarmable and resendable error conditions. Also, includes a test for OK. 

========== ./src/encp.py ====================================================================================

bumping version to v2_19 because of encpCut 

Fixed more potential problems with errno usage. 

Included a check on the input file for reads to make sure the os filesize and the pnfs filesize match. 

Fixed a bug when writing to enstore from dcache. If the file only had read permissions then an unecessary test for write permissions (file and directory) would falsly fail the transfer. 

Fixed a dcache interfacing problem. Encp was trying to make sure the output file had write priledges. It shouldn't even care when dcache is involed what the output files permissions are. I cannot be assumed that all system exceptions contain the attribute errno. Defaults are now in place where needed. 

Moved the FSCORRUPTED test to atomic.py. This removed doing a lisdir for each write transfer. 

Moved a call to os.listdir() outside of a loop. This could be a permformace hit for large directories and multi-file transfers. Added the unique id to some more log messages... 

Added some log messages. These are to help trace when encp does certain things. Others are to make the unique_id more usable. 

Cleaned up the code to use new functions from e_errors for checking the status fields of tickets. 

Spelling fix: recieved -> received. Created the setup_signal_handling() function. Moved code from "__main__" to do so. 

Added a log message that associates unique_id with filenames. Changed FNCTL.O_NONBLOCK to os.O_NONBLOCK in anticipation of using python 2.2. 

bumping version to x2_18_2 because of encpCut 

Fixed an internal comment. 

Made changes to handle problems with 64bit OSF nodes making encp requests. These machines could handle file sizes larger than 2GB-1 within a C int type variable. When the integer is placed in the stringified dictionary it was not containing an appending L for long type. It was this missing L that caused the problemd for the library manager since it runs on a 32bit Linux node. 

venor is now spelled vendor. "unable to registor bfid" error now a warning not informational. Bug fix to the internal error handling mechanism. 

bumping version to x2_18_1 because of encpCut 

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

Change to pass mylint.py. 

Three bug fixes. 1) Empty permissions left after read. 2) OS file size zero and pnfs layer 4 size correct after writes. 3) Files writing under 2) were allowed to be read. 

========== ./src/enstore_constants.py ====================================================================================

add D_MPD_FILE 

no trace levels less than 6

check for drive_id 

========== ./src/enstore_up_down.py ====================================================================================

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

========== ./src/entv.py ====================================================================================

Now uses a .entvrc file to record the geometry of the window when it is closed. It is also possible to change the background color with the .entvrc file. 

Typing on the command line after invoking the entv: entv.py d0en instead of "entv.py d0en &" would cause the status and message threads to abort (like a C^c happened). Now only a C^c will kill entv. 

Working on reducing CPU usage. 

Doesn't crash when resized. Child window for mover status seems stable. 

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

Removed a debug return that prevented unsued clients from being deleted. 

Volume background now diapears along with the text. Other little fixes. 

Everything seems to work *correctly* now. 

Volume class gone. Trace class used. Debugging output (mostly) gone. 

debug 

Added a sleep call. This seems to limit the amount of CPU it uses. 

Faster startup. With new movers, entv can determine the client machine at startup. Death of entv is handled more gracefully. 

Speed up the initialization. Put mover timeouts in during initial status check. Before 0 through k movers were positioned for each k, now when k is positioned that is the only one positioned. Also, changed where the movers get drawn to. 

This includes some general fixes. Mostly having to do with cleaner start and stopping. But some with location of graphics. 

major cleanup. better threading. better startup. ability to reinitalize. 

========== ./src/espion.py ====================================================================================

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

========== ./src/enstore_functions.py ====================================================================================

Changed is_ok() to accept a status (aka a tuple of length two) or a dictionary with an element named 'status' that is a tuple of length two. Previously, it only accepted the dictionary. 

move read_erc to enstore_erc_functions 

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

add subscribe for new config msg 

bug in format 

ping is different on d0ensrv2 

ping node before rcping 

========== ./src/pnfs.py ====================================================================================

Fixed bug if a directory named "root" was in the directory path of a command that took a pnfs id as argument. Enstore was confusing this 'root' directory with the "root" pnfs directory. 

Added to new options, --tagchmod and --tagchown. 

revert to previous version 

if layer 4 is missing, instantiate it as a new file 

take care of moved file 

handle missing field in initialization 

fix File.set_size() again 

fix File.set_size() 

Modified to use option.check_correct_count() to prevent user from entering to many options in by mistake. Removed errnious retry attempts from the pnfs "No such file or directory" bug. 

Fixed the --pnfs-state command. 

Determines if the user is currently in a pnfs directory before allowing a tag to be written/read. 

========== ./src/ftt_driver.py ====================================================================================

make diagnostic messaages reflecting what seek does

========== ./src/monitored_server.py ====================================================================================

check more the mover and lm status tickets 

add self and default 

add fields for lm 

check ticket from mover for completeness 

========== ./src/mover.py ====================================================================================

made the same change to disk mover 

do not calculate CRC in the tape thread if net thread detected a transfer failure 

added volume name to alarm message 

generate an alarm if mover is too long in the certain states 

fixed a bug 

added log message after dismount completes 

1. in assert_volume check a volume label and then decide if it is correct even if there is no label at all. 2. do not dismount tape on ENCP_GONE. 

replace current_work_ticket with wrapper_dict in the vol_labels call 

added trace fro complete CRC 

removed rewriting label for 9940B because firmware was fixed 

Changed FNCTL.O_NONBLOCK to os.O_NONBLOCK in preperation of python 2.2. 

use create_wrapper_dict to get an expected by wrapper dictionary 

added handle_error 

moved log message 

use a vol_labels wrapper method to label blank tapes to match with whatever vrapper requires 

Due to a HW problem a driver does not report a label on the mounted tape, which was causing a traceback during a forced dismount. 

modified restart, added timestamps for mounting and mounted log messages 

attempt to fix an attribute errorr when sending status while reinitializing a buffer 

fixed bug 

changes related to volume assert and drive type in the mounting and mount log messages 

1st running code for the volume assert 

volume assert bugs fixed 

volume assert added 

fixed lint complaint 

changed message in stop_draining 

better way of dealing with specifics of 9940B drive, actually it is bug in the firmware 

Added hack to write label twice. On initial tape density conversion in a 9940B, the drive fails to write the filemark. Rewriting the label and filemark covers up the problem. 

Silly bug in pad subtraction fixed and neat Wayne's shortcut for pad calculation 

read last block with padding and remove pad length from CRC checks this is due to an ILI/ENOMEM on 9940B when you try to read less than full block 

return client_ip in the status message 

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

added client hostname to status info 

========== ./src/null_wrapper.py ====================================================================================

added vol_labels 

========== ./src/plotter.py ====================================================================================

log when listing all volumes 

add a missing return 

========== ./src/file_clerk_client.py ====================================================================================

survive prematural failure of get_brand() 

========== ./src/option.py ====================================================================================

Added the --get-asserts for the library mananger. Added the --mover-timeout for the volume_assert. 

Added to new options, --tagchmod and --tagchown. 

Added the function check_correct_count(). This allows the code to check if the user specified extra options that were not expected. 

========== ./src/configuration_client.py ====================================================================================

bump up trace severities 

remove print 

add subscribe for new config msg 

========== ./src/event_relay.py ====================================================================================

remove some log messages 

========== ./src/file_clerk.py ====================================================================================

log when listing the tape 

ignore pnfs_mapname if the record does not have it 

========== ./src/enstore_display.py ====================================================================================

Negitive positions are possible. The code did not take this into account. The regular expressions parsing the geometry now handle negative positions. 

Now uses a .entvrc file to record the geometry of the window when it is closed. It is also possible to change the background color with the .entvrc file. 

The checkbutton on the menubar is now set to on initially. Also, the resize event -- from a user -- waits a finite amount of time until the window contents are redrawn. Should extra resize events occur the wait time is reset to the full wait time. This should cut down on the number of times the canvas is redrawn when the user is resizing the window. 

Added the menubar with the option to turn off animation. 

Working on reducing CPU usage. 

Fixed the MoverDisplay windows. User can click on a connection and it will change color. Other general cleanups. 

Doesn't crash when resized. Child window for mover status seems stable. 

move non enstore import functions to enstore_functions2 

Removed a debug return that prevented unsued clients from being deleted. 

Volume background now diapears along with the text. Other little fixes. 

When a connection is terminated the line is removed from the display. 

Everything seems to work *correctly* now. 

Volume class gone. Trace class used. Debugging output (mostly) gone. 

Font sizes are good. Some font color changes too. Changes to the timer. Code cleanup. 

The font selection for the mover text will select a size to fit in the designated space. Geometry selection is cleaner. 

Bug fix for font size selection. 

Faster startup. With new movers, entv can determine the client machine at startup. Death of entv is handled more gracefully. 

Speed up the initialization. Put mover timeouts in during initial status check. Before 0 through k movers were positioned for each k, now when k is positioned that is the only one positioned. Also, changed where the movers get drawn to. 

This includes some general fixes. Mostly having to do with cleaner start and stopping. But some with location of graphics. 

major cleanup. better threading. better startup. ability to reinitalize. 

========== ./src/library_manager.py ====================================================================================

fixed a bug in the processing write requests 

This change returns a status to volume_assert.py on the initial request. 

Undue the prevous changes. 

Made changes to the volume assert code. Largest of which is to add the assert pending and active queues to the output from --get-queue. 

These changes are for the volume assert test. 

queue requests with restricted host access, do not ignore them 

fixed a bug introduced in the previous rev. 

expanded fuctionality of restrict_host_access 

more flexible match in restrict_host_access 

explicitely delete a 3rd argument returned by discipline for restrict_version_access
