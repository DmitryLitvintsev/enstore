#	This script reads /proc/scsi/scsi and for each device it creates a special file 
#	/dev/scsi/sg<BUS>d<SCSI ID> with the minor number = the index of the device in /proc/scsi
#
#       It also creates the files /dev/tape/tp<BUS>d<SCSI ID> and /dev/tape/tp<BUS>d<SCSI ID>n
#	again with the minor number  = the index of the device in /proc/scsi for the
#	rewind and norewind tape devices.
#	
#	This script is neccessary because the linux /dev/st and /dev/sg devices change
#	as devices are added to a bus
#
#	The script should normally be run at boot time or if the scsi configuration changes
