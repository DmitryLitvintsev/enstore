    <center><h1>Status-At-A-Glance Help</h1></center>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <B><I>Status-At-A-Glance</I></B> provides the visual status of an Enstore system separated
into 4 major sub-systems; the Enstore servers, the storage medium (<B>TBD</B>), the network
between the computers on which Enstore is running and any alarms that have been raised.
The status for each sub-system as a whole, is presented in a summary section
at the top of the page followed by the status for individual items within each sub-system.  The
<I>alarms</I> sub-system does not have a separate section as it represents a toggle of whether
alarms exist or not.  Once a
problem has been identified it is expected that the more complete and detailed view of the 
<A HREF="status_enstore_system.html">Enstore servers</A>, the 
<A HREF="active_monitor.html">network</A> and the <A HREF="enstore_alarms.html">alarms</A>
will be examined.
<P>
There are 4 levels of status represented on this page -<BR>
<ul>
<li><I>No problems</I> indicated by a <IMG src="greenball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="greenball.gif" border="0">
<li><I>Minor problem</I> indicated by a <IMG src="yelball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="yelball.gif" border="0">
<li><I>Major problem</I> indicated by a <IMG src="redball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="redball.gif" border="0">
<li><I>Situation under investigation</I> indicated by a <IMG src="star.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="star.gif" border="0">
</ul>

In general a <I>Minor problem</I> will indicate that the Enstore system is still operational as a
whole but some piece of it has a problem which should be investigated.  A <I>Major problem</I>
will imply that the Enstore system is not operational.  <I>Minor problems</I> may escalate to
major ones and should not be ignored.  When a server (or enstore) is marked with a 
<IMG src="star.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="star.gif" border="0"> it means that
an unusual situation has been detected and will be monitored.  No mail will be sent until the
situation has been escalated to a problem.
<P>
In addition to showing the status of the system, this page will indicate when
pieces of the Enstore system will be undergoing a scheduled outage by placing a 
<IMG src="checkmark.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="checkmark.gif" border="0"> after the item
and including the approximate time of the start of the outage.
<P>
Sometimes a server or sub-system item will be known to be down.  In this case, the item will have
a <strike>line drawn through it</strike>.

The last section on the page is for informational purposes only.  It lists the nodes in the
Enstore system and the servers that run on each of them.


<h1>Enstore Overall Status</h1>
This section presents a summary of the information on the rest of the page.  The following table
defines what the different status levels mean for each of the sub-systems.<BR>

</TABLE>
<P>
A <IMG src="checkmark.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="checkmark.gif" border="0"> next to one of
these sub-systems, indicates the entire sub-system will be unavailable.  The approximate time
when the outage will begin is included underneath the server in parenthesis.
<P>
If one of these sub-systems is <strike>crossed out</strike>, the entire sub-system can be 
considered to be down.

<h1>Enstore Individual Server Status</h1>
This section presents the status of each individual server in Enstore. Individual servers are
checked to see if they are alive.  A server is not reported as being dead until it has been
found to be not alive for a configurable number of times (this number is set in the 
<A HREF="config_enstore_system.html">configuration file</A> under the key <I>system</I> and
<I>allowed_down</I>).  If a server does not seem to be alive, it is marked with a 
<IMG src="star.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="star.gif" border="0"> until the number of times
it is seen dead is greater than the number specified in the configuration file as mentioned
above.  In the following table, <I>n</I> represents this number.

<h1>Enstore Network Status</h1>
This section contains an element for all nodes mentioned in the configuration file that are not
explicitly listed as being excluded from this measurement.  An <I>encp-like</I> connection is
made between the <B>Base Node</I> and each of the other nodes.  The data communications rate 
between the two nodes is measured.  If the non-base node does not respond to the connection or if
the data transfer rate between the two is 0.0, then the node is marked as <IMG src="redball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="redball.gif" border="0">.  Otherwise the node is marked 
<IMG src="greenball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="greenball.gif" border="0">.
