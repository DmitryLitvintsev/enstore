    <h1>Overview</h1>
The Enstore Plots page, provides information on some statistics that Enstore gathers. These
statistics are gathered from the log files produced by Enstore.  
<P>
Each plot is presented in 3 separate ways - <BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>a small version of the plot (postage stamp) available directly on the page 
<LI>a full size version of the plot available by selecting the postage stamp
<LI>a postscript copy of the plot
</UL>
Next to each plot is the date and time that the plot was created.  These plots are created
by the Inquisitor, when instructed, using the <I>--plot</I> option. 
<P>
This page is not automatically refreshed.

    <h1>Bytes/Day Plot</h1>
This plot shows the total number of bytes that were transferred during both read and write
operations.  In addition the mean transfer size and the mean number of transfers is given.
Data points are represented by a histogram where each bin is one day.

    <h1>Mount Latency Plot</h1>
This plot shows the time (in seconds) between when a mount request is issued, and the 
mount is reported as being done.  Data points are represented by individual points on the
plot.

    <h1>Cumulative Mounts Plot</h1>
This plot shows the total number of mounts/day.  This data is accumulated by the Inquisitor
when producing the mounts/hour plots.  The total number of mounts represented by the plot is
shown next to the title of the plot. Data points are represented as a histogram where each
bin is one day.

    <h1>Transfer Activity (log) Plot</h1>
This plot shows individual transfer activity (log scale for the y-axis).  Each transfer that
completed successfully is shown.  Reads and writes are differentiated by color. Data
points are represented as points on the plot.

    <h1>Transfer Activity Plot</h1>
This plot shows individual transfer activity.  Each transfer that completed successfully is 
shown.  The mean file size per day is also plotted as a different colored square. Read and
write transfers are not differentiated. Data are represented as vertical bars.

    <h1>Mounts/Hour Plot</h1>
This plot shows the number of mounts per hour for a single day.  The total number of mounts
during the day is included next to the title.  Data are represented as a histogram where 
each bin is one hour.
