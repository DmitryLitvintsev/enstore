    <h1>Overview</h1>
The Enstore Plots page, provides information on some statistics that Enstore gathers. These
statistics are gathered from the log files produced by Enstore.  
<P>
Each plot is presented in 3 separate ways - <BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>a small version of the plot (postage stamp) available directly on the page 
<LI>a full size version of the plot available by selecting the postage stamp
<LI>a postscript copy of the plot
</UL>
Next to each plot is the date and time that the plot was created.  These plots are created
by a cronjob that runs once/day.
<P>
This page is not automatically refreshed.
<P>
      Immediately above the plots are 1 or more links to other pages.  The Enstore supplied
links are described here.  The others are user configurable.

<DL>
<DT>Bytes/Day per Mover Plots
<DD>Plots of bytes transferred per day for each individual mover.
<DT>Bytes Written per Storage Group Plot
<DD>Plots of the bytes written by each different storage group
</DL>

    <h1>Drive Utilization Plots</h1>
These plots show a snapshot of the number of drives in use at a given time.  The data are 
plotted by drive type.  There is one plot for each different type of drive in use by the
system.

    <h1>Drive Bytes/Day Plots</h1>
These plots show the total number of bytes transferred during both read and write operations
for each drive type.  There is one plot for each different type of drive in use by the
system.

    <h1>Bytes/Day Plot</h1>
There are 4 different types of Bytes/Day plots -
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Bytes/Day (30 days) - Total number of bytes to and from Enstore in the past 30 days.
<LI>Bytes/Day (30 days) - Total number of bytes to and from Enstore (cumulative).
<LI>Bytes Written/Day (30 days) - Total number of bytes written to Enstore in the past 30 days.
<LI>Bytes Written/Day (30 days) - Total number of bytes written to Enstore (cumulative).
</UL>
In addition the mean transfer size and the mean number of transfers is given.
Data points are represented by a histogram where each bin is one day.

    <h1>Mount Latency Plot</h1>
This plot shows the time (in seconds) between when a mount request is issued, and the 
mount is reported as being done.  Data points are represented by individual points on the
plot.

    <h1>Cumulative Mounts Plot</h1>
This plot shows the total number of mounts/day.  This data is accumulated by the Inquisitor
when producing the mounts/hour plots.  The total number of mounts represented by the plot is
shown next to the title of the plot. Data points are represented as a histogram where each
bin is one day.

    <h1>CDF/D0/STK Total Bytes/Day Plots</h1>
There are 2 plots which show a sum of the data on the 3 systems (CDFen, D0en, and Stken).
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>CDF/D0/STK Total Bytes/Day - Total number of bytes transferred on the 3 systems.
<LI>CDF/D0/STK Total Bytes Written/Day (30 days) - Total number of bytes written to Ensotre on the 3 systems in the last 30 days..
</UL>

    <h1>Transfer Activity (log) Plot</h1>
This plot shows individual transfer activity (log scale for the y-axis).  Each transfer that
completed successfully is shown.  Reads and writes are differentiated by color. Data
points are represented as points on the plot.

    <h1>Transfer Activity Plot</h1>
This plot shows individual transfer activity.  Each transfer that completed successfully is 
shown.  The mean file size per day is also plotted as a different colored square. Read and
write transfers are not differentiated. Data are represented as vertical bars.

    <h1>Mounts/Hour Plot</h1>
This plot shows the number of mounts per hour for a single day.  The total number of mounts
during the day is included next to the title.  Data are represented as a histogram where 
each bin is one hour.

    <h1>Terabytes/Day Plots</h1>
These 2 plots (Null and Real) show instantaeous transfer rates for the NULL movers and the
real data movers for both reads and writes.
