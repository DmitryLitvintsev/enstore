    <h1>Overview</h1>
The Enstore Cron Job Output page, provides a graphical representation of the exit status of
Enstore related <A HREF="http://www-ccf.fnal.gov/ISA/Cron_Job.html">cron jobs</A>.  Each time a cron job runs, it keeps a record of its start time,
exit time, and exit status.  This information is used to generate these plots.  In addition, a cron
job may send email to <I>$ENSTORE_MAIL</I> when it encounters an error.
<BR>
<BR>
Each cron job that runs, will make use of 7 files in the <I>~enstore/CRON</I> directory on the machine
in which it runs. If the cron job runs as root, the <I>CRON</I> sub-directory will be located in
the home directory for root.  These files are described below.  The file names are constucted of a
mnemonic representing the cron job and a short ascii string.  In the following description the cron
job mnemonic is set to <I>backup</I>
