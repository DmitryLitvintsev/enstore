We recoomend to have the following configuration:
For the small system (one robotic library with one or 2 tape drives and few thousands tapes).
Minimal configuration.
host1:  pnfs server, apache web server, configuration_server, log_server, alarm_server, inquisitor,
        event_relay, ratekeeper, postgres DB server, file_clerk, volume_clerk, info_server, accounting_server, 
	drivestat_server
host2: media_changer(s), library_manager(s), mover

*** Note that this configuration may have problems as the number of accesses and their rates increase.

Optimal configuration:
host1 : pnfs server
host2: apache web server, configuration_server, log_server, alarm_server, inquisitor,
       event_relay, ratekeeper
host3: media_changer(s), library_manager(s)
host4: postgres DB server, file_clerk, volume_clerk, info_server, accounting_server, drivestat_server
* host5: backups, plots, migration work, etc.This can be done on one of existing hosts but may interfere with 
operations. 

one host per mover.

HW configuraton: dual CPU processor, at least 2GB of memory, 1Gb/s network interface. Plenty of disk space for
host1, host2, and host4.
