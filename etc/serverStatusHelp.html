    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <I>Enstore System Status</I> shows the most recent known state of the Enstore system.
Each server, mover, library manager and media changer is represented.  Since there may be
many entries in the status table, a shortcut table is listed at the top.  This page will
automatically refresh, based on the value listed in the <A HREF="config_enstore_system.html#inquisitor">inquisitor section</A> of the 
configuration file.  It is created by the inquisitor, and includes the time/date when it was
last updated in its upper right hand corner.

    <h1>Shortcuts</h1>
There are four types of entries in the shortcut table -
<DL>
<DT><B>Servers</B></DT>
<DD>This link points to the section which contains the following servers - 
<UL>
<LI>alarm_server</LI>
<LI>config_server</LI>
<LI>file_clerk</LI>
<LI>inquisitor</LI>
<LI>log_server</LI>
<LI>volume_clerk</LI>
</UL></DD>
<DT><B>library managers</B></DT>
<DD>Each library manager will have a separate entry in the shortcut table.</DD>
<DT><B>Media Changers</B><DT>
<DD>This link points to the section which lists all of the media_changers (in alphabetical
order)</DD>
<DT><B>Movers</B></DT>

</DL>

    <h1>Status Table</h1>
The status table shows the last known status of the servers, library managers, movers and
media changers.  In the following discussion the term <I>element</I> will be used to refer
to any of these.  Each element displays a <B>Status</B>. This is the first row of information
associated with each element.  The library managers and movers
display this <B>Status</B> and additional information.  The color of the background for the
name of an element (first column), represents a visual cue to the status of the element.
