    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <I>Enstore Server Status</I> shows the most recent known state of the Enstore system.
Each server, mover, library manager and media changer is represented.  Since there may be
many entries in the status table, a shortcut table is listed at the top.  This page will
automatically refresh, based on the value listed in the <A HREF="config_enstore_system.html#inquisitor">inquisitor section</A> of the 
configuration file.  It is created by the inquisitor, and includes the time/date when it was
last updated in its upper right hand corner.

    <h1>Shortcuts</h1>
There are four types of entries in the shortcut table -
<DL>
<DT><B>Library Managers</B></DT>
<DD>Each library manager will have a separate entry in the shortcut table.</DD>
<DT><B>Movers</B><DT>
<DD>This link points to the section which lists all of the movers (in alphabetical
order)</DD>
<DT><B>Unmonitored Servers</B></DT>
<DD>This link points to the section which lists all of the servers (in alphabetical
order) which are listed in the configuration file but which the inquisitor is not
monitoring.  Each individual server entry in the <A HREF="config_enstore_system.html">configuration
file</A>, will have <I>inq_ignore</I> in it to indicate that this server will not be 
monitored by the inquisitor. </DD>
<DT><B>Full File List</B></DT>
<DD>This link points to the page that contains a list of all of the user files that
are currently being transferred by enstore.</DD>
</DL>

    <h1>Status Table</h1>
The status table shows the last known status of the servers, library managers, movers and
media changers.  In the following discussion the term <I>element</I> will be used to refer
to any of these.  Each element displays a <B>State</B>. This is the first row of information
associated with each element.  The library managers
display this <B>State</B> and additional information.  The color of the background for the
name of an element (first column), represents a visual cue to the status of the element.
