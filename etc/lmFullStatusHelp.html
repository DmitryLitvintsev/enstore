    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <I>Enstore Full Library Manager Info</I> shows the most recent known state of a
library manager.  This page will
automatically refresh, based on the value listed in the <A HREF="config_enstore_system.html#inquisitor">inquisitor section</A> of the 
configuration file.  It is created by the inquisitor, and includes the time/date when it was
last updated in its upper right hand corner.

    <h1>Library Manager Table</h1>
The library manager table shows the last known status of the library managers in question.
The color of the background for the library manager
name (first column), represents a visual cue to the status of the library manager.
