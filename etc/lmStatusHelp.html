    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <I>Enstore Library Manager Queues</I> gives detailed information about the
internal queues and status of the library manager.  These queues include an element for each
write or read job that is currently being worked on or is pending.  In addition, a summary of
non-idle and non-active movers is given at the end.  Idle movers are those that are waiting for
work.  Active movers are those that are working on reading or writing a file (this includes
mounting and seeking operations).  This page will
automatically refresh, based on the value listed in the <A HREF="config_enstore_system.html#inquisitor">inquisitor section</A> of the 
configuration file.  It is created by the inquisitor, and includes the time/date when it was
last updated in its upper right hand corner.

<h1>Status</h1>
The status of the library manager as reported on the <A HREF="status_enstore_system.html">Server 
Page</A> is included here as well.

<h1>Suspect Volumes</h1>
A library manager will mark a volume as suspect with respect to a certain mover if the mover
encounters an error while accessing that volume. The suspect volume list on this page includes
each volume for which this has happened, followed by a list of the
movers that reported an error for that volume.

<h1>Reads</h1>
This is the list of files in the library manager internal queue that are to be read from Enstore.
Each file corresponds to an <I>encp</I> job.  The files are sorted by volume,
and within the volumes, are sorted by priority.  The volumes themselves are sorted by
priority.  Here is an example -
<BR><BR>
<table align=center cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>&nbsp;<strong><a NAME="EFB000"><a HREF="tapeHelp.html">EFB000</a></a></strong></td><td>[at&nbsp;<a HREF="enstore_moversHelp.html">DD42.mover</a>]</td><td>fndad</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data/a_data_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;File&nbsp;:&nbsp;14)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>fndad</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data/another_data_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;File&nbsp;:&nbsp;15)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>fndad</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data/yet_another_data_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;File&nbsp;:&nbsp;17)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<strong><a NAME="EFB001"><a HREF="tapeHelp.html">EFB001</a></a></strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>fndad2</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data/a_data2_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;File&nbsp;:&nbsp;15)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>fndad2</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data/a_pending_data_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;File&nbsp;:&nbsp;15)</td></tr>
</table>
<BR><BR>
In this example, the volume labeled EFB000, has 3 files that users want to read from it.  The first file, at
position 14, is currently being read bu mover DD42.mover.  The other 2 are pending.  The volume labeled
EFB001, has 2 files on it to be read, both of which are waiting for an available mover.  The CurPri value
is the current priority of the file read.
<BR><BR>
<B>NOTE</B>: Only the last 70 characters of the filename are displayed.

<h1>Writes</h1>
This is the list of files in the library manager internal queue that are to be written to Enstore.
Each file corresponds to an <I>encp</I> job.  The files are sorted by file family, and within the
file family list, are sorted by priority.  The file families themselves are sorted by priority.
Here is an example -
<BR><BR>
<table align=center cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>&nbsp;<strong><a NAME="file_family1">file_family1</a></strong></td><td>[at&nbsp;<a HREF="enstore_moversHelp.html">DD23.mover</a>]</td><td>fndad2</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data2/write_file_here</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;FFWidth&nbsp;:&nbsp;2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>[at&nbsp;<a HREF="enstore_moversHelp.html">DD24.mover</a>]</td><td>fndad2</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data2/write_different_file_here</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;FFWidth&nbsp;:&nbsp;2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<strong><a NAME="file_family2">file_family2</a></strong></td><td>[at&nbsp;<a HREF="enstore_moversHelp.html">DD25.mover</a>]</td><td>fndad</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data2/another_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;FFWidth&nbsp;:&nbsp;2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>fndad</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data2/another_different_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;FFWidth&nbsp;:&nbsp;2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;<strong><a NAME="file_family3">file_family3</a></strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>fndad1</td><td><font color="#0000FF">/neo/data2/write_this_file</font></td><td>(CurPri&nbsp;:&nbsp;1&nbsp;FFWidth&nbsp;:&nbsp;1)</td></tr>
</table>
<BR><BR>
In this example the file family <B>file_family1</B>, has 2 files currently being written to Enstore using movers
DD23.mover and DD24.mover.  The file family width for this file_family is 2, so that is the maximum number
of writes that can be concurrent.
<BR>
File family <B>file_family2</B>, also has 2 files to be written, one is being written now by mover DD25.mover.
The other file is pending and is waiting for a free mover to be able to write it.  Notice that this file
families width is 2.  There are many reasons why the second job is still pending, such as -
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>All movers are busy</LI>
<LI>The file was just submitted and will soon be given to an IDLE mover</LI>
<LI>A file is being read from a volume which belongs to this file family and the volume is not full.  This
volume will also count against the file family width because it is being read and <B>is not full</B>. Thus
there would be 2 volumes mounted for this file family that <I>could be written to</I> and the
second write job will not be given to a mover until one of the other 2 volumes is no longer being accessed. </LI>
</UL>
<BR>
File family <B>file_family3</B>, has 1 file pending (waiting to be written) for any of the reasons as discussed
above.
<BR><BR>
The mechanism for giving jobs to IDLE movers is very complex and takes into account many more factors
than are listed here.

<h1>Additional Movers</h1>
Any movers that are in one of the following states are listed here -
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>CLEANING</LI>
<LI>DISMOUNT_WAIT</LI>
<LI>ERROR</LI>
<LI>HAVE_BOUND</LI>
<LI>OFFLINE</LI>
</UL>

This includes movers that are not currently waiting for a job (IDLE) or busy working on a job
(SETUP, MOUNT_WAIT, SEEK, ACTIVE).  The following information is listed for the mover -
<BR><BR>
<TABLE align="CENTER" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="5" border="2" width="100%" bgcolor="#DFF0FF">
<TR><TH BGCOLOR="#FFFFF0">Additional Mover</TH><TH BGCOLOR="#FFFFF0">State</TH>
    <TH BGCOLOR="#FFFFF0">Volume</TH><TH BGCOLOR="#FFFFF0">File Family</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Mover name</TD><TD>Mover internal state</TD>
    <TD>Volume Label of volume in drive</TD>
    <TD>File family of the volume</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
