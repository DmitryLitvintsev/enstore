    <h1>Resolving Alarms</h1>
Raised alarms may be resolved by selecting 1 or more alarms and then pressing 
<IMG src="execute.gif" alt="Execute" border="0" align="CENTER">.
Alarms are selected by pressing the button contained within the Key column of the table.  More than
one alarm may be selected at a time. 
<P>
<IMG src="reset.gif" alt="Reset" border="0" align="CENTER"> will clear all selections in the
event that an error is made.
<P>
After one or more alarms have been resolved, a minimalist page will be displayed listing the keys of
the resolved alarms, or listing any errors that occurred during the resolution process.  Remember to
reload the active alarm page after resolving an alarm.
