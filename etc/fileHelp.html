    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <I>Enstore Active File List</I> shows all the currently active user files in the
Enstore system.  These are the files that are being written to Enstore or are being created 
locally due to a read from Enstore, or are pending for one of these operations.  This page will
automatically refresh, based on the value listed in the <A HREF="config_enstore_system.html#inquisitor">inquisitor section</A> of the 
configuration file.  It is created by the inquisitor, and includes the time/date when it was
last updated in its upper right hand corner.


<h1>Active User files Table</h1>
The files are arranged by node on which the encp job is running, and within the node, 
alphabetically.
This listing can be searched using browser tools.

Each file, is a link to the library manager queue element that involves this file.
