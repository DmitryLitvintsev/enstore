<h2>Background:</h2>
    
The Enstore volume import system is to allow tapes generated outside
of Fermilab to be added to the D0 tape inventory managed by
Enstore. <p>
      
This process comprises two stages:  creating the tape volumes
off-site, and importing these into our tape library.<p>
      
Tapes that are to be added to Enstore must be properly labelled and
written in a compatible format.  Also, additional information
(metadata) about the tape volumes and the files it contains - such as
checksums - must be collected at the time the tapes are written and
submitted to the Enstore administrators along with the tape volumes
themselves.<p>
      
A simple standalone program has been developed to facilitate the
process of creating the Enstore volumes and associated metadata files.
This has been developed in ANSI C for portability and to eliminate the
dependence on system utility programs (e.g. <code>tar</code>, <code>mt</code>, <code>cpio</code>), the
behavior of which can vary from system to system.  It is available as
a binary for Fermi-supported UNIX systems and as C source code for
other systems.<p>
      
<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
    
You must have a compatible tape drive <B>[XXX]</B> which operates in
non-rewinding mode, and you must have sufficient permissions to write
to this device.<p>
      
You must use approved tapes with barcode labels assigned by Fermilab.<p>
      
The volume import software needs a directory to store its tape
database.  This database amasses information about files and volumes,
and persists until the volumes are shipped to us.  This persistent
storage of metadata makes it possible to add files to a tape which had 
been started at an earlier date - it is not necessary to write the
files to the volume all at one time.<p>
      
The tape device and tape database directory can be specified on the
command line or as the environment variables <code>TAPE_DEVICE</code> and <code>TAPE_DB</code>.
Specifying this information as environment variables eases the use of
the software somewhat, since these values will then not need to be
typed on every command-line.<P>
      
If the specified tape database directory is not present, it will be
created when the software is run for the first time.<p>
      
      
<h2>The <code>enstore_tape</code> program:</h2>
    
The program that is used to write (and later, read) Enstore tapes is called 
<code>enstore_tape</code>.  It has four main modes of operation,
 selected by the first (non-optional) command-line argument, which
 must be one of <code>--init</code>, <code>--write</code>, <code>--dump-db</code>, or <code>--read</code>.  The use of each of these options is explained in the following.

<h3><code>enstore_tape --init</code></h3>
    
This must be run to label a new tape and initialize a database entry
for this tape, prior to writing any files to the tape.<p>

Usage:<p>
<PRE>
enstore_tape --init [--tape-device=devname] [--tape-db=dbdir] 
 [--verbose] [--erase]  --volume-label=label
</PRE>

If <code>TAPE_DEVICE</code> or <code>TAPE_DB</code> are set in the environment, the
corresponding command-line arguments are not necessary.  <code>$TAPE_DEVICE</code>
must be a non-rewinding device, and <code>$TAPE_DB</code> must be a path to a
directory (which will be created if needed) where the user has write
permission.<p>

The volume label must be a legal volume label, matching the external
barcode label on the tape<p>

If the tape is already labelled with a VOL1 header, or if the local
tape database already has an entry for the given volume label, then
<code>enstore_tape --init</code> will refuse to relabel the tape.  In order to
override this, use the <code>--erase</code> option, which erases both the existing
tape label and the local database entries.  Use this option with
caution.<p>


<h3><code>enstore_tape --write</code></h3>

Once a tape is labelled, you can begin adding files to it.  To do this 
use the <code>--write</code> mode of the <code>enstore_tape</code> program.<p>

Usage:<p>

<PRE>
enstore_tape --write [--tape-device=devname] [--tape-db=dbdir]
  [--verbose] --volume-label=label <i>file_list</I> [<i>file_list...</i>]
</PRE>

<code>tape-device</code>, <code>tape-db</code>, and <code>volume-label</code> are as described above.<p>
<code>volume-label</code> must match a label already existing in the local database 
(i.e. the tape must have been labeled by <code>enstore_tape --init</code>).<p>

Each <i>file_list</i> takes the form:
<PRE>
  --pnfs-dir=path [--strip-path=path] filename [filename...]
</PRE>

<code>--pnfs-dir</code> specifies the directory in the PNFS file space (i.e. the
file namespace within Enstore itself) where the files are to appear,
when the tape is actually added to the Enstore library.  These paths
must start with /pnfs.  The <code>--pnfs-dir</code> argument is "sticky", that is,
it applies to all subsequent files until another <code>--pnfs-dir</code> argument
is specified. <code>--strip-path</code> specifies a leading pathname component
which is to be stripped from the filenames when they are imported into
Enstore.  (This argument may be omitted).  Finally, one or more
filenames are specified.<p>

A few examples may clarify this usage:<p>

To specify all local files in the directory /tmp/sim/data starting
with "MC", and cause them to be imported into the PNFS filesystem in
the directory /pnfs/test/data, use<p>
<PRE>
  --pnfs-dir=/pnfs/test --strip-path=/tmp/sim/ /tmp/sim/data/MC*
</PRE>

To specify all files in the current directory, and insert them into
the PNFS file system in /pnfs/test<p>

<PRE>
  --pnfs-dir=/pnfs/test *
</PRE>
Multiple <i>file_list</i>s may be specified. <p>

Tapes need not be rewound after writing.  This is convenient in the
case that further files are to be appended to the tape. <p>
	
Note that currently <code>enstore_tape --write</code> does not descend into
subdirectories.  All of the filenames specified on the command line
must be files rather than directories. If any of the filename
arguments are directories they will not be written to tape (and an
error message will be printed).  This may be changed in a future
version of the program.<p>


<h3><code>enstore_tape --dump-db</code></h3>

The final step (prior to shipping the tapes) is to turn the local
database directory into a flat file so that it can be easily submitted 
via FTP or electronic mail.  The <code>--dump-db</code> option of <code>enstore_tape</code>
accomplishes this task.  <p>

Usage:<p>

<PRE>
enstore_tape --dump-db [--tape-db=dbdir] > output_file
</PRE>
If <code>tape-db</code> is not specified, the value of the environment variable
<code>TAPE_DB</code> is used.  <p>

<H2>Reading Enstore Tapes</H2>
    
Since the format used for writing Enstore tapes is based on Unix
standards, Enstore tapes can be read without needing special software.
You can use the Unix commands <code>mt</code>, <code>dd</code>, and <code>cpio</code> to read Enstore
tapes.  The <a href=ftp://www.gnu.org/pub/gnu/cpio>GNU</a> version of <code>cpio</code> is suggested, although other
versions will probably work (the cpio flags in the example below will
need to be changed if you use a non-GNU cpio.)<p>

Assuming that the tape device is <code>/dev/tape</code>, to read back
the third file from a tape, you would use the following commands

<pre>
<i>#rewind the tape</i>
mt -f /dev/tape rewind   
<i>#skip the VOL1 header and the first two files</i>
mt -f /dev/tape fsf 3                 
<i>#extract the cpio archive contents</i>
dd bs=32768 if=/dev/tape | cpio -idv --no-absolute-filenames  
</pre>

After performing these steps, the tape will be positioned and ready
for extracting the fourth file.  To reposition the tape to read the
<i>n</i>'th file repeat the <code>mt rewind</code> and <code>mt
fsf</code> commands. <p>

For simplicity, and to reduce the dependence on external utility
programs, an <code>--read</code> option to <code>enstore_tape</code>,
similar to the <code>--write</code> option, is planned.  This option
is not yet implemented.<p>



<H2>Implementation Details:</H2>

The local <code>TAPE_DB</code> database simply uses the Unix directory structure to 
arrange keys, subkeys, and values as directories, subdirectories, and
files.  This allows simple shell-scripts to be written to query the
local database.<p>

Tape volumes begin with a modified ANSI VOL1 header: 80 bytes of data,
starting with "VOL1", followed by the volume label, padded by space
characters up to a final character of ASCII "0" (not NUL).  Files are
written in variable-blocksize mode, with a default blocksize of 32768,
in Posix cpio-odc format.  Files are separated by a standard EOF
marker.  At the end of the tape come 2 EOF markers.  <p>

In order to make it easy to add files to an existing tape without
rewinding and seeking to the end of data, an EOT header is written
*after* the 2 EOF markers.  The EOT header is similar to the VOL1
header, except that it starts with EOT and 7 ASCII digits giving the
number of files already written to this tape.  Following this is the
volume label as in the VOL1 header. <p>

After files are written to tape, the EOT header is written, and the
tape drive backspaces to the beginning of the EOT header.  On
subsequent writes, the <code>enstore_tape</code> program will check to see if
such an EOT header is present at the current tape location; if it is,
(and the volume names and file counts match) it is safe to continue
writing to this tape without rewinding and seeking to end of tape - we
simply skip backwards over one of the EOF markers preceding the EOT
header.  If the EOT header is not found, the tape is rewound and the
VOL1 header is sought. <p>

Checksums are generated using the Adler32 algorithm.  In addition to a 
checksum of the entire file, a "sanity" checksum (for early
error-detection) is generated using the first 65536 bytes of the file
(if the length of the file exceeds 65536 bytes).<p>
