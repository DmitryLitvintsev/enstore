    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <B><I>Network Status-At-A-Glance</I></B> provides the visual status of the
Enstore network that connects each of the nodes running a server or a mover.  Once a
problem has been identified it is expected that the more complete and detailed view of the 
<A HREF="active_monitor.html">network</A> will be examined.
<P>
There are 2 levels of status represented on this page -<BR>
<ul>
<li><I>No problems</I> indicated by a <IMG src="greenball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="green ball" border="0">
<li><I>Minor problem</I> indicated by a <IMG src="yelball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="yel ball" border="0">
</ul>

A <I>Minor problem</I> will indicate that the transfer rate between the base node and the 
target node is 0, the target node is unreachable, or perhaps the monitor_server is not running on
the target node.

<h1>Enstore Network Status</h1>
Each node mentioned in the configuration file is listed here.  A node may however,
be explicitly marked in the configuration file to be excluded from this measurement.  
An <I>encp-like</I> connection is
made between the <B>Base Node</B> and each of the other nodes.  The <B>Base Node</B> is the node 
that initiates all of the network communications used to evaluate the state of the network.

The data communications rate 
between the two nodes is measured.  If the non-base node does not respond to the connection or if
the data transfer rate between the two is 0.0, then the node is marked as 
<IMG src="yelball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="yelball.gif" border="0">.  Otherwise the node 
is marked <IMG src="greenball.gif" height="15" width="15" alt="greenball.gif" border="0">.
