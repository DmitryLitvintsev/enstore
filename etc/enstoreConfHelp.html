<h2>Control of Ethernets on Client Systems</h2>

<h3>Default Control</h3>

By default, encp will use the DNS name obtained by the "hostname"
command for control messages. Encp uses whatever routing the client
system or network  administrator sets between the client system
and the Enstore system for data transfers.

<p>Typically, the default configuration will suffice for machines with a
single network interface, or a machine with a single network interface
dedicated for data movement.

<p>Data are moved with the default TCP window size on the machine. There is a
potential for an extreme performance degradation if the default window is
set too large.  A value of about 32K works well at most locations at Fermilab.

<h3>enstore.conf -- Detailed Control</h3>

Administrators can create an enstore.conf file to allow for multiple network
interface cards dedicated to Enstore, and to allow for a different IP address
to be used for the encp control socket. The default location for the file is
/etc/enstore.conf. The location of the file can be overridden with the environment variable ENSTORE_CONF.

<p>The file format supports comments, a hostname line, and one of more
interface lines.
</p>

<h4>Comment Lines</h4>

Comment lines begin with a "pound" sign, "#".

<pre>
Example:

# this is s comment line

</pre>

<h4>Hostip line</h4>

The "hostip" line is used to override the DNS name that encp
uses in the bind command when doing a (passive) open on on a socket
used to listen for the mover to call it back. There should be 1
hostname lines per enstore.conf file.  It must be the IP of one
of the  IPs listed on an interface entry in this file.


<pre>
Example:

hostip=131.225.42.42

</pre>


<h4>Interface lines</h4>

This feature of enstore.conf is used when data transfers over more than one
network interface are necessary. An enstore.conf file would typically contain
at least two of these lines, since a single interface can be controlled more
conventionally with static routes. Currently the interface lines are only
supported and exercised in IRIX machines. The underlying implementation
mechanisms for multiple interfaces are portable, and the scheme can be
extended on demand. When more than two interfaces are used on IRIX systems, it
is necessary to have each interface on its own subnet. The enroute2 executable must be installed and setuid root on the machin for this feature to take effect.

<p>All five keyword must be present on an interface line.

<dir>
<li> The "interface" key word specifies the network device.

<li>The "weight" keyword specifies the relative capacity of each interface.
For example, if 1 gbps and 100 mbps interfaces are used, they might be
assigned weights of 30 and 10, respectively.

<li> The "ip" keyword specifies an ip address corresponding to the device on
the "interface" keyword.

<li> The "gw" keyword specifies an ip address corresponding to the gateway to
the Enstore movers for the "interface" keyword.

<li> The "cpu" keyword is used on IRIX systems. Network transfers are often
CPU limited. The amount of CPU used per transfer can be minimize if the CPU
used by encp has hardware affinity with the slot holding the network card,
and if the same CPU performs interrupt service on for the network card.
</dir>

<pre>
Example:

interface=eg2 weight=10 cpu=2 gw=131.225.32.32 ip=131.225.32.31
interface=eg3 weight=10 cpu=3 gw=131.225.32.36 ip=131.225.32.35
