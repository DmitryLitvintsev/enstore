This is a small, stand alone test of enstore. I imagine that
it us useful for testing the servers in a stand-alone fashion.

It works with the default data in the file 

$(ENSTORE_DIR)/src/configuration_server.py


1) Starting from scratch: 

setup -r <CHECKED_OUT_ENSTORE_DIR> enstore
cd <CHECKED_OUT_ENSTORE_DIR/bin>
make clean
make
cd <MY_OWN_TEST_AREA>  - NOT YET, SOON
./newdbs
beg_loadtest

(let run for a while)
(error  about long1.dat is acknowledged, and needs fixing...)

stopall


2) Re-use -- must have done 1) above and not done a make clean.

cd <MY_OWN_TEST_AREA>
olddbs
beg_loadtest

(let run for a while)
(error  about long1.dat is acknowledged, and needs fixing...)

stopall
