This software has been made freely available with a request for
collaborative input subject to standard Fermitools Terms and Conditions
given in full below.

                             PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                             ===================
This is the Fermi Tape Tools product (ftt).
It provides an insulating layer which allows device and platform independent
tape input, output, and control, including interrogating supported drives for
usage, error, and other statistics.  Informational calls which are available
for some drives/platforms and not others are allowed to yield an
"I don't know" result; this allows portable applications to take advantage of
such information when it is available.  Operations that require superuser
privileges, like changing device density or obtaining statistics, are
handed off to a set-uid-root executable; installers can replace the set-uid
executable with /bin/true if they are unwilling or unable to allow those
privilege to the software, with a corresponding decrease in functionality.

The ftt package provides several pieces:
(1) platform-insulating direct SCSI i/o routines
(2) platform-and-drive insulating tape i/o routines
(3) a command line/script interpreter interface to (2)
(4) test scripts for (3) to test the software and to test
    tape drives.
Along with a users guide and porting guide.

The first two layers are in the ftt_lib directory, and build libftt.a
The second two layers are in the ftt_test directory.




Documentation
-------------
       User documentation is found in "doc"  directory in the
        distribution, or via WWW at:

            http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ftt


Required Hardware and Software
------------------------------

Currently, ftt fully supports Exabyte 82xx, Exabyte 85xx, and Quantum DLT
tape drives, on AIX, IRIX, Solaris (SunOS), and Digital Unix (OSF1).  Other
drives are not specifically supported and receive "generic" drive support,
which includes input, output, and positioning, but very little in the way
of statistics collection.


Product Installation
