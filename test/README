You need a hsm lock directory and lock file:
client_node_install   will create it for you

You also need pnfs to be available for your machine.
This requires adding your node to the pnfs export list.
See bakken if you can't access it.

To mount pnfs:
    choose 1:
        irix-options="hard,intr,rw,noac"
        options="hard,intr,rw"
    mount -o $options pcfarm4:/enstore  /pnfs/enstore

Small, stand alone tests of enstore.

To run the tests:

        setup -r <CHECKED_OUT_ENSTORE_DIR> enstore

        cd $ENSTORE_DIR/test

Starting from scratch:

        make clean newdbs

Re-use -- must have done started from scratch and not done a clean

        make olddbs


Stopping the tests:
        killall -9 longtest
