This is a small, stand alone test of enstore. I imagine that
it us useful for tesint the servers in a stand-alone fashion

It works with the default data in the file 

../configuration_server.py


1) Starting from scratch: 

make clean
make
newbds
beg_loadtest

(let run for a while)
(error  about long1.dat is acknowlged, and deeds fixing...)

stopall


2) Re-use

olddbs
beg_loadtest

(let run for a while)
(error  about long1.dat is acknowlged, and deeds fixing...)

stopall



3) BEFORE ANY CVS CHECK IN

make clean

(It is a bug that all of this needs to be run inside the product,
and will be cleaned up as soon at we get the thing UPS-ified, so we
can make proper references to files within the product from outside the
product.) The need ofr make clean should then go away.
