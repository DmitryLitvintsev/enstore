This is a small, stand alone test of enstore. I imagine that
it us useful for testing the servers in a stand-alone fashion.

It works with the default data in the file

To run the tests:

        setup -r <CHECKED_OUT_ENSTORE_DIR> enstore

        cd $ENSTORE_DIR/test>

Starting from scratch:

        make clean newdbs

Re-use -- must have done started from scratch and not done a clean

        make olddbs


Stopping the tests:
        killall -9 longtest
