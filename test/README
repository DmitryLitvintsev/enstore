This is a small, stand alone test of enstore. I imagine that
it us useful for tesint the servers in a stand-alone fashion

It works with the default data in the file 

../configuration_server.py


1) Starting from scratch: 

Use the "newdbs" command to load some data fiules into a file, which
is acting like a faked up raw disk device. This file is named 
"file.fake"

lacking pnfs, the files that are loaded, along with a bit file I.D.
will be listed in the file  files.in

Lacking a proper database behind the 
	file clerk
	volume clerk
A journal files are created,
	bit_file_server.jou, volume_clerk.jou

2) Starting not from scratch

	Use to "olddbs"  connad, and file.fake is assumed to be 
	described by  bit_file_server.jou and volume_clerk.jou
	all of which is consistent with "file.fake"


3) RUnning a stress test:

	type beg_loadtest.
	
	this runs multiple processes which simulteanously try to read
	data from the dtabase,and laod up the system.
