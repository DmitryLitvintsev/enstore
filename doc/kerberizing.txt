in the following mail, 'MYNODE' should be replaced with
the name of the node to be kerberized.  also all commands
are given using 'bash' syntax.

1. send email to yolanda to get principals for your machine.
        the request must be made like -

        host:host/MYNODE.fnal.gov
        ftp:ftp/MYNODE.fnal.gov

2. wait until you get email from compDiv stating these new
        principals exist.

3. make sure the time on your machine is within 1 or 2 minutes
        of the real time.  if not, reset it.  KERBEROS WILL
        NOT WORK IF THE TIME IS TOO FAR OFF.

4. install kerberos on your machine using upd.
        (the following example assumes that the current
          version of kerberos is suitable for your machine.)
        
        (do the following as user products)
        % setup upd
        % upd install kerberos

        (do the following as user root)
        ## make sure that the current sshd_config file is in
        ## /etc.  if it is in /etc/ssh then you will need to
        ## do the following line (otherwise skip this line)
        % export KRB_SSHD_CONFIG=/etc/ssh/sshd_config

        % ups install kerberos
        (make sure no errors are printed out)
        % killall -HUP inetd
        % killall -HUP sshd

5. if you have a non-empty hosts.deny file, move it out of the
        way, now kerberos should be protecting you.

        (as root)
        % cd /etc
        % mv hosts.deny hosts.deny.prek
        % touch hosts.deny

6. change the kerberos configuration file to allow logins to get
        forwardable tickets. make the following section in the
        config file look like -

        login = {
                krb5_run_aklog = false
                krb5_get_tickets = true
                krb4_get_tickets = false
                krb4_convert = false
                forwardable = true
        }

        (as root)
        % cd /etc
        % emacs krb5.conf

7. if this node is an enstore node, do the following -

7a. copy the appropriate k5login file from $ENSTORE_DIR/etc to
        ~enstore/.k5login

7b. copy the apropriate root k5login file from $ENSTORE_DIR/etc to
        ~root/.k5login

7c. make sure all root cron jobs that do rsh/rcp/ssh/scp now do enrsh/enrcp.

7d. make sure all enstore cron jobs that do rsh/rcp/ssh/scp now do enrsh/enrcp.

7e. run kadmin as enstore to enable the enstore project to get tickets without
        user input.

        (only jon, bonnie or eileen can do this)
        (as user enstore) (the file '/local/ups/kt/enstorekt' could be put anywhere)
        % /usr/krb5/sbin/kadmin
        Enter password:
        kadmin:  addprinc -randkey enstore/cd/hostname.domain
        kadmin:  ktadd -k /local/ups/kt/enstorekt enstore/cd/hostname.domain
        kadmin:  exit
 

8. if you want users to be able to run cron jobs that use rsh or rcp
        kcroninit  must be run by every user.  i found that when it is run
        the first time (on linux), it will create a directory under /var/adm.
        the permissions will be set wrong, they must be -

        ripcon.fnal.gov} lsf /var/adm     
        total 3
        drwx--x--x   3 root     g023         1024 Apr  6 15:04 ./
        drwxr-xr-x  15 root     root         1024 Apr  6 15:04 ../
        drwx--s--x   2 root     root         1024 Apr  6 15:04 krb5/

        change this, if it is wrong and rerun kcroninit.  once this is set
        right, it will work for everyone else.

well, that is all i remember.
