<ul>

<li> Each serial line is configured at 19200 baud rate.

<p>
<li> The linux kernel, via lilo, has been configured to send its root
console output to ttyS0. The kernel sends its output to ttyS0 by
adding "append="console=ttyS0,19200 console=tty0 ..." to the kernel
stanza.

<p>
<li> The barracuda 9 GB hard drives need to have several options
enabled to operate efficiently.  Do this by adding a line to each
stanza of lilo.conf: append=".... console=tty0
ncr53c8xx=tags:4,sync:10,ultra:y"

<p>
<li> The bios needs to be configured to use vt100 terminals, xon/xoff
flow control, and ???.  Also lilo needs to have the following line
once, ahead of all stanzas, "serial=0,19200n8".

<p>
<li> Gettys need to be running on the nodes in order to open a tty
session. The /etc/inittab has to have "c:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty
ttyS0" line.

<p>
<li> A backup of the system ide disk is made once per day to
rip8:/fnal/enstore/servers/[srvN|movers].  This allows one to have an
up-to-date copy in order to replace a failed node. Procedures (tarit
and loadit in /root) are in place to do this; One also needs the
d0enrtbt floppy to create a replacement system disk.

<p>
<li> Although a system disk backup is made daily, the user's home
directory files are not copied. No one should be saving files on these
nodes without copies in appropriately backed up machines.


<p>
<li> The nodes are running Fermi Redhat v5_2, but lots of the uneeded
rpms have been deleted.

<p>
<li> Autorpm auto installation is allowed for redhat rpms and
disallowed for others.  During productions, all installation will be
disabled and only notification will be sent when files need to be
upgraded.


<p>
<li> rgang has been modified to allow copying files across all nodes
(the -C and -c options) and to disable printing the headers (the -n
option).

</ul>
