<ul>

<li> Each serial line is configured at 19200 baud rate.

<li> The linux kernel, via lilo, has been configured to send its root
console output to ttyS0. The kernel sends its output to ttyS0 by
adding "append="console=ttyS0,19200 console=tty0 ..." to the kernel
stanza.

<li> The barracuda 9 GB hard drives needs to have several options
enabled to operate efficiently.  Do this by adding a line to each
stanza of lilo.conf: append=".... console=tty0
ncr53c8xx=tags:4,sync:10,ultra:y"

<li> The bios needs to be configured to use vt100 terminals, xon/xoff
flow control, and ???.  Also lilo needs to have the following line
once, ahead of all stanzas, "serial=0,19200n8".

<li> Gettys need to be running on in order to open a tty session. The
/etc/inittab has to have "c:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty ttyS0" line.

<li> A backup of the system ide disk is made once per day to
rip8:/fnal/enstore/servers/[srvN|movers].  This allows one to have an
up-to-date copy in order to replace a failed node. Procedures (tarit
and loadit in /root) are in place to do this; One also needs the
d0enrtbt floppy to create a replacement system disk.

<li> Although a system disk backup is made daily, the user's home
directory files are not copied. No one should be saving files on these
nodes without copies in appropriately backed up machines.
