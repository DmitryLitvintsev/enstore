There are 2 console servers for the D0En cluster, d0ensrv3 and
d0ensrv5.  Normally there would only be one console server per Enstore
system, but since there are PC nodes on both sides of the AML/2 robot,
it was easier have 2 console servers.  Each console has full
functionality for the entire system..  For example, a console for any
Enstore PC, except the console servers themselves, of course, can be
gotten from either console server.

<p>
<p>
The console servers have these major purposes:

<ul>

<li> Provide access to the Enstore PC root consoles via its ttyS0.

     <br> To get a console:

     <ul>

         <li> Log in as root to one of the console servers.

         <li> If you are running X11, type "cons nodename"; for
         example "cons d0ensrv2" or "cons d0enmvr11a". Make sure you
         allow console server xhost access to your local node.

         <li> If you are not running X11, then type "console nodename"
         and the software runs in your current environment.

         <li> If you actually typing on the console monitor, you can
         use the start menu or right-button menu to do the same thing.

     </ul>

<p>
<li> Provide access to the Enstore PC boot bios via its ttyS1.
    <br>
    <ul>
          <li> Getting a console for the boot bios is the same as the
          kernel consoles, except you attach "bios" to the node
          name. For example, "cons d0ensmvr11abios".

          <li> The boot bios screens are only active when the PC is
          booting.

          <li> Eventually, it will be possible to reset the node using
          the serial reset capabilities of the BMC over the bios
          windows.
     </ul>


<p>
<li> Provide backup storage (disk and tape) for primary pnfs and
enstore databases and other important information. This only runs on
d0ensrv3 for now.
   <br>
    <ul>
          <li> Once an hour, the pnfs databases are copied from
          d0ensrv1 to /diska/pnfs-backup. Files are kept on disk for
          approximately 1 week.

          <li> Once an hour, the enstore databases are copied from
          d0ensrv1 to /diska/enstore-backup. Files are kept on disk
          for approximately 1 week.

          <li> Once an hour, the entire (except for unreadable files
          MPTN/ETC/TRUSERS|OS2/SYSTEM/SWAPPER.DAT|tcpip/DOS/ETC/TRUSERS)
          from the AML/2 OS/2 node adic2 is mirrored to
          /diska/aml2Shadow. This provides a simple way to see what is
          on the adic2 node as well as a backup.

          <li> Every 15 minutes, the enstore log files are copied from
          d0ensrv2 to /diska/enstore-log-backup. These files are not
          critical to keeping the system running, but are our source
          of what happened.  They are copied more frequently than the
          critical files because this is the only copy we have (the
          d0ensrv1 databases are on mirrored and duplicated disks).
          Files are kept on disk for approximately 1 week.

          <li> Twice a day, at 7 AM and 7 PM, a backup of files
          currently on disk is made to tape.  There is a full backup
          Monday and Thursday mornings.  [This is a sticky flag, a
          full backup is attempted until it is successful.]  The other
          backups are incremental since the last full backup.

             <ul>

                <li> The tape drive is a local (not in the AML/2
                robot) mammoth-1 drive.

                 <li> Tapes get full, and then need to be replaced,
                 about once a month.

                 <li> Enstore's volume-import procedure is used to
                 create the backup of the disks (not fmb).  This
                 allows us to insert the tape, if we need to, into the
                 AML/2 robot and read the information with
                 Enstore. The volume import information resides in
                 /diska/BackupTapeDB.

                 <li> Individual files are not copied to tape. Rather
                 a tar container of each major section is created
                 first and that is what is backed up to tape.  These
                 tar containers are created in /diska/BackupToTape.

              </ul>

    </ul>


<p>
<li> Provide a netscape browser for examining Enstore's current state.
    <br>
    <ul>

          <li> The easiest way to get the browser is log in as root
          and type "donet". This will bring up the correct status page
          for you automatically and with the correct uid.

          <li> Alternatively, you can just type "netscape" and then
          hit the "home" button. But don't run netscape as root. Log
	  in as enstore instead.

          <li> If you actually typing on the console monitor, you can
          use the start menu or right-button menu to do the same
          thing.

     </ul>

<p>
<li> Provide a logical place to control or monitor Enstore.  The
console servers are the nodes people should log into and not any of
the other ones.

    <br> To monitor/control the other nodes:
    <ul>

          <li> Log in as enstore (not as root!)

          <li> Get the correct environment "setup enstore"

          <li> To issue an enstore command: "enstore command &lt
          farmlet &gt &lt options &gt". For example, "enstore EPS"
          will list the enstore processes on all enstore nodes;
          "enstore EPS d0enmvr" will list the enstore processes on
          just the mover nodes; and "enstore EPS d0ensrv1" will list
          the enstore processes on just d0ensrv1.  See other sections
          for more details on controlling enstore.

    </ul>

<p>
<li> There is a local mammoth-1 tape drive that allows administrators
to examine and/or copy tapes.  This allows detailed investigation
outside the AML/2 and without affecting the users.

</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Cron jobs executing on d0ensrv3:
<ul>

<li> user enstore - aml2mirror.  If this fails, the most likely reason
is that the adic2 OS/2 computer is not working or the network
connection to it is unavailable.

<br>
<li> user enstore - backup2Tape. If this fails, the most likely reason
is that the tape is full or damaged and needs to be replaced. You will
get mail warning you the tape is almost filled and needs
replacing. You'll also get mail when the tape drive cleaning bit is
set and needs to be cleaned.

    <br> To replace a tape, put a new labelled tape into the drive and
    <ul>

          <li> log in as root to d0ensrv3

          <li> type the following:
                <ul>
                    <li> TAPE=/dev/rmt/tps0d4n;         export TAPE
                    <li> TAPE_DEVICE=$TAPE;             export TAPE_DEVICE
                    <li> TAPE_DB=/diska/BackupTapeDB;   export TAPE_DB
                    <li> setup enstore
                    <li> $ENSTORE_DIR/volume_import/enstore_tape --init --erase --volume_label= &lt NEW_LABEL &gt
                </ul>
           <li> edit $TAPE_DB//CURRENT_TAPE and enter the  &lt NEW_LABEL &gt  of the replacement tape.

     </ul>


<li> user root - perm.  If this fails, look in /diska/pnfs-backup for
"peculiar" things.  Report it to a developer.

<br>
<li> user root - tarit. If this fails, the most likely reason is
because either rip8 (the backup node for the ide system disk) or the
network connection to rip8 is down.

</ul>



<br>
<br>
<br>
Console Software
<ul>

<li> The software was gotten from http://www.gnac.com/conserver/.
This is a more up-to-date version of the console software typically
distributed in the standard Fermi console server distribution.

<li> The escape sequence is "^Ec &lt command_letter &gt "; "h" for the command
letter gives you a list of commands'

<li> The logs of all traffic on the console and bios screens are saved
in /var/log/conserver. {Note, they are not on a separate disk
/usr/farm.) The console server log of itself is in
/var/log/conserver.log.

<li> Occasionally a port seems to get "stuck" and you can't
communicate with it.  Usually if you send a ^Q, the port will
clear. If that doesn't work, type "cylines -r" and check for errors.

<li> The console software is started on bootup.  To do it by hand,
type "/etc/rc.d/init.d/conserver stop" or "/etc/rc.d/init.d/conserver
start".

</ul>



<br>
<br>
<br>
Bootup
<ul>

<li> The console server software is started.

<li> FTT makes /dev/rmt scsi devices.

<li> The BMC watchdog is armed and deadman is started at real-time
priority.

<li> You need to start the window manager manually by logging in and
typing "startx".

</ul>




<br>
<br>
<br>
Some Details:
<ul>

<li> A Cyclades Cyclom-YeP Multiport Module provides the serial
connectivity to various ports.

<li> Each serial line is configured at 19200 baud rate.

<li> The linux kernel, via lilo, has been configured to send its root
console output to ttyS0. The kernel sends its output to ttyS0 by
adding "append="console=ttyS0,19200 console=tty0 ..." to the kernel
stanza.

<li> The barracuda 9 GB hard drive needs to have several options
enabled to operate efficiently.  Do this by adding a line to each
stanza of lilo.conf: append=".... console=tty0
ncr53c8xx=tags:4,sync:10,ultra:y"

<li> The bios needs to be configured to use vt100 terminals, xon/xoff
flow control, and ???.  Also lilo needs to have the following line
once, ahead of all stanzas, "serial=0,19200n8".

<li> Gettys need to be running on in order to open a tty session. The
/etc/inittab has to have "c:12345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty ttyS0" line.

<li> For reasons I don't understand, the linux cyclades kernel appears
to have to be built on d0ensrv3 and d0ensrv5 before it recognizes the
cyclades hardware.  This seems to mean that the kernel make process probes
the hardware, which seems very unlikely.  In any event, right now the
linux kernel needs to be remade (without changing any options in the
config file) on each console server node.  This is a small problem not
worth worrying about.

<li> A backup of the system ide disk is made once per day to
rip8:/fnal/enstore/servers/srv3 and rip8:/fnal/enstore/servers/srv5.
This allows one to have an up-to-date copy in order to replace a
failed node. Procedures (tarit and loadit in /root) are in place to do
this; One also needs the d0enrtbt floppy to create a replacement
system disk.

<li> Although a system disk backup is made daily, the user's home
directory files are not copied. No one should be saving files on these
nodes without copies in appropriately backed up machines.

<li> The console server nodes can be booted without affecting normal
enstore operations. You might get some errors from the cron jobs when
you boot the node.

<li> The xscreensaver (http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver) software is
running in the background in the background. This software helps
identify the console server on its monitor.

</ul>
