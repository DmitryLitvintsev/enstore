The current tests 
	a. create 8 various size files in a directory
	b. copy these files to "final media"
	c. start off 9 independent tasks who read the files back
		and compare them to the original file.
	

To run the tests:

        cd $ENSTORE_DIR/test

Starting from scratch:

        make clean newdbs

Re-use -- must have done started from scratch and not done a clean
          and the enstore servers must be runing (enstore-start command)

        make olddbs


Stopping the tests:
        killall -9 longtest
	and be patient - this needs some work.
