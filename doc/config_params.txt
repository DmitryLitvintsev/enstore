   filemarks)
   check_written_file if greater than 0, then randomly check files written
   using this number as the mean (default value:0 - no check)

   (other than IDLE or ACTIVE) (default - 600 s)
   max_in_state_cnt  if this counter expires Mover errors out with "Mover
   stuck..." message. (default - 3)
   statistics_path path to the statistics file(default - None)
   compression 0 means no compression. Everything else means use the drive
   compression (default: None - use the drive compression)
   get_remaining_from_stats get remaining bytes info from drive
   blank_error_increment Sometimes ftt returns FTT_EBLANK for not blank tapes.
