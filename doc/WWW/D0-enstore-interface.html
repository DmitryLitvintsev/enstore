<H1>Sam/Enstore Interface Notes.</h1>

Below are note on the SAM/Enstore interface provided by D0.
For the most part, Ensrote complies in software features. Exceptions
are noted.

<H2>
SAM/Enstore Interface</H2>
The SAM data access layer will use the command/executable provided by Enstore
to issue file commands.
<P>The basic format of this command is one of the following:
<P><em>encp</em>&nbsp; &lt;input file>&nbsp; &lt;destination directory
in pnfs space>
<BR><em>encp</em>&nbsp; &lt;file in pnfs file space>&nbsp; &lt;output
file>
<P>The exact syntax of the above may be changing somewhat, but is immaterial.
<P>The following enhancements have been requested and (we think) agreed
to by Enstore.
<BR>&nbsp;

<TD NOSAVE>Request to Enstore</TD>

<TD>&nbsp;Implementation proposed</TD>

<TD>Rationale</TD>
</TR>

<p><em>The notational issues in the first two items have not been addressed.
Enstore provides CP-like list features. The user can launch many encps.</em></p>

<TR NOSAVE>
<TD NOSAVE>Allow wild cards in input or output file spec. As each file
arrives some notification should be provided.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Enstore will implement notification by writing a message to stdout.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Permits a number of files to be supplied or dispatched serially with
one encmd.&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
<TD>Allow list of comma delimited files in input or output file spec</TD>

<TD>Notification of each file arrival (or dispatch) as for wild cards.</TD>

<TD>Permits a number of files to be supplied or dispatched serially with
one encmd.&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>At the end of each file transaction provide information about the physical
location of the file, its position on the tape, error/retries, which tape
drive it was written on.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>This was originally discussed as being written to stdout along with
informational messages about the state of the copy job.&nbsp; Latest thoughts
appear to be to write all metadata related to the physical location of
the file and how it got there into a separate, but parallel pnfs file system,
into a file of the same name (we think?)</TD>

<TD>It is very convenient when doing queries in order to gather information
on files to optimize access patterns and when making reports,&nbsp; to
have all of the physical information on the files in the SAM Oracle file
and event catalog. Multiple pnfs query calls would be awkward and unsymmetric
with respect to files managed by SAM, but not stored in the Enstore Robot
space.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Allow additional parameters on the enstore 'copy' command to control
the positioning of the job in the enstore job queue.&nbsp; Initial priority,
Aging Delta Time and Priority Increment would be sufficient.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Exact implementation of the desired effect left to Enstore. Whether
at a certain priority a job becomes pre-emptive of a job already in progress
left for later stages of the project, after some experience with resource
allocation.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Need some degree of control over the ordering and priority of jobs
already submitted to the enstore queue, in order to balance the flows of
data and minimize job latency where necessary, but without rigid allocation
of resources to particular access modes or projects</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>At the end of each file transaction provide information about the job
which copied the file - dwell time in queue, final priority, robot arm
wait time, file seek time, file transfer time and MBs, etc.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>This is now going to be available in the parallel pnfs file metatdata
file system</TD>

<TD>This information is needed by the Global Resource Manager in order
to feed into the algorithm which adjusts the rate of flow of jobs by access
mode.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>When an enstore job fails because of a tape error or failure of the
receiving encmd (or network or whatever) the job queue of enstore should
be cleaned up appropriately.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Could live without this in 1st implementation, but would be nice to
determine what is appropriate behavior in each of the possible failure
modes. We are expecting automatic retries when tape cannot be read or written
in a particular drive and the tape only marked as unreadable if tried in
n drives.</TD>

<TD>SAM does not wish to handle tape errors, tape statistics or retries
- merely to note relevant information on state of media and record drive
used in the File and Event Catalog</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>If the STK robot and a couple of drives cannot be hooked up with an
enstore test system by October 1, then Enstore needs to emulate the delays
of a robot for Tape mount, File seek time, and File transfer time, in order
to test the Global Resource Manager.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Part of this is already implemented as a 'simple' model.&nbsp; Is this
adequate - it is not installed yet, SAM have not tried it.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Essential to simulate queing for scarce resources - the tape drive,
and the network bandwidth.&nbsp;</TD>
