                      ENCP release notes, from v3_8 to v3_8a

Encp changes:
=============

This release contains the same contents as v3_8; the difference is that this
encp has been patched to return the correct exit status.  Version v3_7c,
v3_7d and v3_8 all had a serious bug where encp would return zero (0)
for failed transfers or successful transfers.

Misc.:
======
