<h1>Products</h1>

<P>Deliverables shall be in the form of UPS products. ENCP and Enstore
shall be distributed	 via UPD.  The distribution of PNFS is described
below.

<P>Deliverables shall have a directory structure which is a sub-tree
of the development tree. Files in the distribution shall be in
directory which corresponds to the file's place in the development
tree.

<P>The deliverable tree shall not include CVS directories.


<h2>PNFS product</h2>

<p>One copy of this software is needed per ENSTORE installation.  

<p>PNFS is supplied by DESY. DESY allows us to use it on site, and
would like to supply any off site users with this software.

<p>It is desirable to package PNFS as a UPS product.  The actual
requirements on PNFS packaging are TBD.  It is TBD whether there is
compile time configuration required with this package.

<h2>Enstore product</h2>

<P>The Enstore product shall contain the Enstore servers + the mover +
ENCP. 

<p>The Enstore product shall contain user documents and administration
documents.

<h2>ENCP product</h2>

<p> The ENCP product shall contain files sufficient to run, install
and maintain the ENCP program. ENCP may be merged into FMSS.  The ENCP
product shall not require a python interpreter as a run-time UPS dependency.

<p> The ENCP product shall contain ENCP user documentation.


<h1>Enstore Directory Names</h1>
