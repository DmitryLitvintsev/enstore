Enstore is a simple system whose goal is to solve the mass storage
needs of the Fermilab community for large HEP data sets.

As such it is not a general purpose mass storage system, but optimized
to allow access to large datasets made of many files.

The special to HEP requirements supported are:

1) The system supports random access of files, but also streaming, the
sequential access of successive files on tape. The system treats robot's
shelves as a scarce commodity.


It has been designed by a mixture of people with expertise in writing DA
systems, and thus, the writing and reading tapes is done in a reliable and
efficient manner.  Recommended software engineering practices are being used
during it's design and development.

The Enstore system provides a generic interface for end users to efficiently
use mass storage systems as easily as if they were native file systems.

It is
based on a true client-server
model that allows hot swapping components and dynamic configuration, is
platform independent, runs on heterogeneous environments and is easily
extendable.  Most
of the operations are transparent to the user.  System performance is monitored
and fine tunable.  A great deal of care has been taken to ensure that it is
able to prevent or to recover from a worst case scenario.  The system has
layers around it to customize and address problems as they occur.  When
possible, these layers are expected to use already existing components
(e.g. ftt, pnfs).
