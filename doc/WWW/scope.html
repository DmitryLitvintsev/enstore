Enstore is a system to provide mass storage for large Run II data sets.  As
such it is not a general purpose mass storage system, but optimized to
allow access to large datasets made of many files.  The system supports
random access of files, but also streaming, the sequential access of
successive files on tape. The system treats robot's shelves as a scarce
commodity.

<p>

Enstore has been designed to provide logging of data directly from the
experiment's data acquisition systems. The writing and reading of tapes
must therefore be reliable and efficient, and the system must be robust
enough to support this critical application without compromising data
taking.  Enstore's goal is to provide a system that can be extended as
needed for the experiments actual data taking needs, as well as be easily
maintainable for the duration of several data taking runs.

Enstore provides the following features:

<menu>

  <li>Support for several types of serial media accessed through Automated
       Tape Libraries or locally mounted on the client or host computers.

  <li>Support for distributed access to data on these tapes.

  <li>Reliable, efficient and prioritized write access from the experiment
       data acquisition systems for the logging of raw data.

  <li>Optimzed access to large (Petabyte) datasets made up of many (100s of
       millions) of files of 1-5 Gbytes in size.

  <li>Efficient and flexible support for "write streaming" of data to tape,
       where data is physically clustered on tapes according to a simple
       classification scheme - typically the trigger number associated with
       the event data written.

  <li>Management of hardware and software resources, e.g., a limited number
       of available tape drives to allow prioritized access to the data.

  <li>Swapping of hardware components - tapes, tape drives, and computers -
       without bringing down the complete system.

  <li>Complete error reporting and configurable response to error
       conditions.

  <li>The use of already tested components as far as possible.

  <li>Easy mechanisms for testing of the system.

  <li>Import and export of tapes between the Automated Tape Library(ies)
       and shelf storage without bringing down the complete system.

  <li>Support for distributed clients to access data through standard
       network protocols, and to a great extent transparently.

  <li>Sequential access of data in files, for event reconstruction and
       other large data processing requirements.

  <li>Random access to files on tapes, to support general event analysis.

  <li>Functionality in layers such that the primitive tape read/write
       software can be used in situations where the full functionality of
       resource management, name translation and access optimization is
       not needed.

<p>

The Enstore system provides a generic interface for end users to
efficiently use mass storage systems as easily as if they were native file
systems.  It is based on a client-server model that allows hot swapping of
hardware components and dynamic software configuration, is platform
independent, runs on heterogeneous environments and is easily extendable.
Most of the operations are transparent to the user.  System performance is
monitored and fine tunable.  A great deal of care has been taken to ensure
that it is able to prevent or to recover from a worst case scenario.  The
system has layers around it to customize and address problems as they
occur.  When possible, these layers are expected to use already existing
components (e.g. ftt, pnfs).
