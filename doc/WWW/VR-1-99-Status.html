Since the June 1998 Von Ruden Review, progress has been made on many
fronts. Here is a short summary of the effort during the last 6 months.

<ul>
  <li> Requirements understood - many discussions with D0 folks, and SAM group in particular

  <li>Technical Design Document - expanded greatly, includes examples and
       command syntax.

   <li> <em>Encp</em>
	<ul>
	  <li> User client program - Distributed via Fermilab's UPD mechanism
	  <li> Completely static, binary task with no dependencies
	  <li> Same syntax as normal Unix cp command, including input file list and output directory specification
	  <li> Special D0 Sam output completed.
	  <li> Option added that lists what transfers are active and pending for a given node.
	  <li> Optimal transversal over tape.
	</ul>

   <li><em>Pnfs</em>
 	<ul>
	  <li> The pnfs servers have been installed and thoroughly tested on 3 Linux machines.
	  <li> A user query oriented script has been written.
	  <li> The servers can be installed via Fermilab's UPD mechanism.
	  <li> A directory tree based on volumes and file families has been added to aid the users in doing optimal tape transversals.
	</ul>

   <li> Error Control, Robustness and Retries - extensively studied and developed in all sections of the Enstore.
	<ul>
	  <li> Trace debugging tool (based on VME work) written for python - solved many problems
	  <li> Timer task written and available for scheduling
	</ul>

   <li> Enstore Servers
	<ul>
	  <li> Underlying communication protocol very reliable.
	  <li> Config Server - is now the sole location of all Enstore config information allowing easy maintenance.
	  <li> Volume and File Clerks - more robust, disaster recovery procedures almost in place.
	  <li> Library Manager - Priority, aging, optimal tape transversal
	  <li> Mover - optimal and overlapped IO, flexible user  wrappering mechanism in place, CRC studies complete (adler32)
	  <li> Log Server  - little work done, useful as is.
          <li> Media Changer - converted to C module, CDF STK code incorporated, EMASS module almost written
	       EMASS training attended by 3 of Enstore group.
	  <li> Inquisitor and Alarms - new since last review, central location for user to see what is happening with system,
	       many useful web pages, plots, patrol investigations begun.
	</ul>

   <li> Volume Import and Export - plan for remote sites understood (not done)
   <li> Test System - constructed and working.
</ul>
