<h3>Enstore v.s. Locally attached tape</h3>

<p>If you are used to using locally attached commodity tape drives, you
will have to appreciate the differences between locally attached tape 
and a pool of network attached tape, such as implemented in Enstore.</p>

<dir>

<li> + You will see higher availability since the failure of any one tape
device will not significantly reduce your ability to analyze your data.

<li> + You will see much lower mount latencies since tape mounts are
automated.
 
<li> - You will burn more CPU moving the data to and from tape because
IP data transfers are inherently less efficient than direct SCSI
transfers.

<li> - Expansion of the Tape I/O capacity of large servers requires
relatively more capacity planning and system engineering compared to
locally attached tape.

<li> + For most applications, expansion of Tape I/O to farms of P.C.'s
requires less planning, since the network I/O, when implemented by a
switched Ethernet scales naturally by just expanding the system.

<li> + You get, for free, a distributed catalog of your files, usable
from any computer you use for analysis. You can manipulate this 
catalog with UNIX commands, like "ls" and"find".

<li> - The utility of the catalog is limited by the UNIX commands; You
had better not do silly, unscalable things like put alot of files into
a single directory.

<li> + Since Enstore decouples tape library slots from the number of tape
volumes you have. You are still limited only by the number of
tapes you can afford, not by the number of tape slots the Computing
Division can afford to buy.

<li> + You are able to control which files are place on which tapes,
and able to explicitly iterate though tapes while reading files, if you
are used to working in this style.  However the mechanisms used to do
this need to be learned.

</dir> 

<p> Therefore the main new computer systems task is to allow for data to
flow between your computer and the enstore system as good rate. Enstore
is deployed in a scalable fashion data are transferred between tape and
network at full network rate. The Enstore system is capable of 
immense throughput -- each tape stream will move data at about 10 MB/sec.
The steps that are needed to make data flow well to any particular 
computer are:

<dir>

<li>Specify the number and type of Network Interface cards for your computer
to allow good throughput, keeping in mind that a unit of throughput is 
10 MB/sec.

<li>Have the network group analyze the network between your system and the 
Enstore servers, the goal being to guarantee throughput and eliminate the 
any substantial chance of packet loss.

<li>Unit test the network. looking for throughput of about 10 MB/sec.
Enstore provides the command "Enstore Monitor" to do this:
<pre>

           $ setup -q stken  encp
	   $ enstore monitor

</pre>

<li>Check that the file systems you will use to hold data have good throughput,
for example by using the "bonnie" benchmark. Make sure they will transfer data 
at rates greater than 10 MB/sec.

<li> examine ans regularise the UIDs and GIDs on all computert systems
used by your experiment.

<li>Use the encp command to test actual data transfer rates of large
files (bigger than 200 MB) between your system and tape.  You can use the 
web pages at:

<pre>

     http://stkensrv2.fnal.gov/enstore/

</pre>

to see transfer rates for your transfers.

<li>Resolve any problems.

<p> To use enstore obtain the "encp" product from the computing division.
Contact the ISD department via the Computing Division office for detailed
help and to arrange for resources and other tangible items.


<h3>Tape Planning</h3>

<p>As you provide for an adequate computer installation, you should begin to
plan how you will use your tapes.</P>

<h3>Volume and Slot Quotas</h3>

<p>The computing division office will provide you with a quota on
robot slots and tapes.  Unlike the HPSS system you can have more tapes
than slots. When this is the case, your experiment needs to specify
which tapes should be readily available within the tape library, and which
tapes will be in the FCC vault. 

<p>In late FY2000, the need to actually do this is moot, because we
are enjoying a surplus of tape slots. However, if the system is
successful, this may not be the case in the future. Chances are you
will become slot-limited, and will need to remove some of the datasets
you are make today from the library. Therefore, it is important that
you begin to use enstore by planning how files should fit onto tape,
allowing for their transfer to the FCC tape vault as their use becomes
less likely.


<h3>Putting data on tape</h3>

<p> In addition  to the quota issues discussed above it is often desirable
to concentrate related data on the same tapes. Factors to consider are:

<dir>

<li> The need to minimize tape mounts (which cause wear on the tape
and delays in your processing).

<li> Limited and controllable impact to your statistics should a
tape be damaged and files become unrecoverable.

<li> Allow you to conserver your tape quote by scratching and re-using
tape volumes when the data on them are no longer meaningful.

<li> Allow you to manage your tape library slot quota by removing tapes
unlikely to be accessed to the Fermilab Tape vault.

</dir>


<h3>File families</h3>

The mechanism provided by enstore is called "file families". It has two
components, a "name" and a "width".  These are completely administered by
the experiment.

<h4>File family names</h4>

<dir>

<li> Each non-empty tape has a string that the experiment makes up
called a "file family" associated with it. The name should consist
of alphanumeric characters and the special characters "_" and "-".

<li> Any given file being written to tape has a file family name
associated with it (How this is done is discussed below). The file
will either be written to a tape with other files in the same family
or to a new,blank volume.

<li> A tape is closed for writing when Enstore estimates that the next
file to be put on it will not fit.

<li> A tape is closed for writing when current file being written to it
does not fit. (n.b. the write is re-tried on a new volume,
transparently to you when this happens)

</dir>

<h4>File Family Width</h4>

<p> File family width limits the number of tape drives which will
be brought to bear to write files into a file family. (note that
enstore does not "Stripe" files across tape, to exploit the
bandwidth advantage of two tape drives you have to transfer two 
files into enstore simultaneously.)

<p> The rule of thumb for administering file family width is "no wider
that needed to sustain throughput".  This requires that you know the
underlying bandwidth for a tape drive in the stken system and eagle
library.  Take this as 10 MB/sec.

<p> Setting the file family width to a higher value than this requires
some thought and consideration. Among items to consider are:

<dir>
<li> If I am rate-limited writing to enstore, is the limitation really the
number of tape drives? Or is there a network or local bottleneck?

<li>If I raise the width, will my files be less concentrated on the
minimal number of tape volumes?  Will this enhance or confound the
subsequent reading of the data?

</dir>

<h4>Administering File families</h4>

<P>The PNFS name space provides a mechanism called "tags".  "tags" are  data
buckets bound to directories in the PNFS name space.  New directories (which
are make by the unix "mkdir" command) inherit the tags of the parent directory.

<P>Enstore picks up a default file family and a default file family
width from the directory in the name space as the file is being written
to tape. The "enstore pnfs -tags <tagname>" command is used by the experiment
to administer these default file families and file family widths.

<p> The following  illustrates how to administer file families:

<pre>

$ setup encp
$ cd /pnfs/.......
$ enstore pnfs --file_family newfilefamily
$ enstore pnfs --file_family_width 2
</pre>

<h4>Time Ordering of Volumes</h4>
<p>A side effect of this implementation  is that enstore will not seek to 
put a tiny file at the end of a tape volume it has finished filling.
This means the volumes in a file family will be time-ordered.  This 
will be useful to you the day your slot quota forces you remove, say,  older 
data from a file family , but not all data you put into a file file family. 




<h2>Transfers </h2>

<h3>encp</h3>

<p> encp is meant to be similar to the unix "cp" or copy utility.
its basic syntax is 
<pre>

    encp inpath outpath

</pre>

<p>One of inpath or outpath must be absolute pathnames beginning with "/pnfs".
The other path must  refer to a local disk.  If outpath is in the PNFS
name space then you are writing to tape. If inpath is in the PNFS name
space then you are reading from tape.

<p>If outpath is a directory, then inpath may be list of files.  If inpath
is in the PNFS space, then the request is optimized in the following way:
the names are sorted by file family and an traversal through the tapes
which minimizes mounting and spacing is arranged for.

<p>If outpath is not in the PNFS name space it must be a disk directory or file
however the special path "/dev/null" is allowed as well.  In that case the
output is written to /dev/null.

<p> encp takes a variety of options, the ones you should concern yourself with are:


<pre>


--verbose=n           where n is between 1 and 9       makes encp chatty
--crc                                                  computes a CRC on the your computer
--data_access_layer                                    prints diagnostic output on stdout


</pre>


<h3>Notes on Reading your tapes</h3>

<p> If you have to read many files, staging some at a time, it is good to think a bit about
what will make the staging  efficient.

<p>For a Simple case, where the files were written to a file family with width
of 1, traversing the files in the order they were created should prove
efficient, since enstore by default does not go back to pack little files at
the end of tapes.  If you did not keep your own time ordered record of the
your files, you can use the UNIX "ls -t" command to place your files in time
order.

<p> If your situation is more complex, then you can use enstore's pnfs command
to minimize tape mounts. This is more complicated, but if the file family
width was ever greater than one, may prove to be worth the effort.

The command yields alot of information about a specific file, in particular it
will tell you the name of the volume it was written on.

<pre>

 enstore pnfs --info filename


 Example:



$ enstore pnfs --info  /pnfs/theory/serial/D/0048/d/ser_D48_qf_d_d_0.1373_1.46_800000
bfid="96204504900000L";
bfid2="96204504900000L";
volume="VO0126";
location_cookie="0000_000000000_0000031";
size="764411940L";
file_family="theory-serial-D-0048-d";
filename="/pnfs/theory/serial/D/0048/d/ser_D48_qf_d_d_0.1373_1.46_800000";
orig_name="/pnfs/theory/serial/D/0048/d/ser_D48_qf_d_d_0.1373_1.46_800000";
map_file="/pnfs/theory/volmap/theory-serial-D-0048-d/VO0126/0000_000000000_0000031";
pnfsid_file="000300000000000000007040";
pnfsid_map="0004000000000000000149F0";

</pre>

If you eval this command in a posix shell, you will get local shell variables
you can use to drive scripts:

<pre>

$ eval `enstore pnfs --info  /pnfs/theory/serial/D/0048/d/ser_D48_qf_d_d_0.1373_1.46_800000`
$ echo $volume
VO0126

</pre>

You can use the volume name to find all other files on that tape:

<pre>

$ enstore pnfs --volume $volume
/pnfs/theory/volmap/theory-serial-D-0048-d/VO0126
$ enstore pnfs --files /pnfs/theory/volmap/theory-serial-D-0048-d/VO0126
