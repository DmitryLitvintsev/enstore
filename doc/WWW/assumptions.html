<h1> Constraints </h1>

A constraint is a factor that limit our our implementations.

<menu>

<LI> A useable system must be available in tiume for vertical slice tests
in June, 1999.

<LI> The system must be apropos for Run II use, and have a place in the overall
storage strategey for the laboratory.

<LI> HPSS is the Run II project baseline, and Enstore is an option.  Hardware
apropos to HPSS may be purchased, such as AIX computers. Enstore should be
able to use those resources, should it replace HPSS as the baseline.

<LI> Enstore must read the current set of data in the IBM tape library.

</menu>


<h1> Assumptions </h1>

Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes will be considered to
be true, real, or certain.


<menu>

<LI> The DESY name space is useable for Enstore, available to FNAL, and
useable for Run II sized applications.

<LI> Fermilab FTT, a platform-independent SCSI tape package is suitable for
the selected hardware,  and useful over Run II projects.

<LI> Tape drives may be attached to user's computers via IP, and an adequate
IP based network is constructed for Run II.

<LI> A non-transparent interface FMSS or FMSS-like interface + C API is
aproporate for the users.
