<h1> Constraints </h1>

A constraint is a factor that limits our implementations.

<menu>

<LI> A usable system must be available in time for vertical slice tests
     in June, 1999.

<LI> The system must be apropos for Run II use, and have a place in the
     overall storage strategy for the laboratory.

<LI> HPSS is the Run II project baseline, and Enstore is an option.  Hardware
     apropos to HPSS may be purchased, such as AIX computers. Enstore should
     be able to use those resources, should it replace HPSS as the baseline.

<LI> Enstore must read the current set of data in the IBM tape library.

<LI> Binaries should be distributed to the users. We should not expect users
     to have to deploy a large infrastructure on their computers to use enstore.

</menu>


<h1> Assumptions </h1>

Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, will be considered to be
true, real, or certain.


<menu>

<LI> The DESY name space is usable for Enstore, available to FNAL, and usable
     for Run II sized applications.

<LI> Fermilab FTT, a platform-independent SCSI tape package is suitable for
     the selected hardware, and useful over Run II projects.

<LI> Tape drives may be attached to user's computers via IP, and an adequate
     IP based network is constructed for Run II.

<LI> A non-transparent interface FMSS or FMSS-like interface + C API is
     appropriate for the users.

<li> Python is an appropriate choice for implementing the project.  Loadable C
     modules will be used where appropriate, for example, to increase
     performance.
