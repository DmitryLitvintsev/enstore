<h2><a name="overview">
1 Enstore Architecture
</h2>
The Enstore system provides a generic interface for end users to
efficiently use mass storage systems as easily as if they were native file
systems.

<p>

<h2><a name="scope">
1.0.1 Scope
</h2>

Enstore is a system to provide mass storage for large Run II data sets.  As
such it is not a general purpose mass storage system, but optimized to
allow access to large datasets made of many files.  The system supports
random access of files, but also streaming, the sequential access of
successive files on tape. The system treats robot's shelves as a scarce
commodity.

<p>

Enstore has been designed to provide logging of data directly from the
experiment's data acquisition systems. The writing and reading of tapes
must therefore be reliable and efficient, and the system must be robust
enough to support this critical application without compromising data
taking.  Enstore's goal is to provide a system that can be extended as
needed for the experiments actual data taking needs, as well as be easily
maintainable for the duration of several data taking runs.

<p>

Enstore provides the following features:

<menu>

  <li>Support for several types of serial media accessed through Automated
       Tape Libraries or locally mounted on the client or host computers.

  <li>Support for distributed access to data on these tapes.

  <li>Reliable, efficient and prioritized write access from the experiment
       data acquisition systems for the logging of raw data.

  <li>Optimzed access to large (Petabyte) datasets made up of many (100s of
       millions of) files of 1-5 Gbytes in size.

  <li>Efficient and flexible support for "write streaming" of data to tape,
       where data is physically clustered on tapes according to a simple
       classification scheme - typically the trigger number associated with
       the event data written.

  <li>Management of hardware and software resources, e.g., a limited number
       of available tape drives to allow prioritized access to the data.

  <li>Swapping of hardware components - tapes, tape drives, and computers -
       without bringing down the complete system.

  <li>Complete error reporting and configurable response to error
       conditions.

  <li>The use of already tested components as far as possible.

  <li>Easy mechanisms for testing of the system.

  <li>Import and export of tapes between the Automated Tape Library(ies)
       and shelf storage without bringing down the complete system.

  <li>Support for distributed clients to access data through standard
       network protocols, and to a great extent transparently.

  <li>Sequential access of data in files, for event reconstruction and
       other large data processing requirements.

  <li>Random access to files on tapes, to support general event analysis.

  <li>Functionality in layers such that the primitive tape read/write
       software can be used in situations where the full functionality of
       resource management, name translation and access optimization is
       not needed.

</menu>

<p>

Enstore is based on a client-server model that allows hot swapping of
hardware components and dynamic software configuration, is platform
independent, runs on heterogeneous environments and is easily extendable.
Most of the operations are transparent to the user.  System performance is
monitored and fine tunable.  A great deal of care has been taken to ensure
that it is able to prevent or to recover from a worst case scenario.  The
system has layers around it to customize and address problems as they
occur.  When possible, these layers are expected to use already existing
components (e.g. ftt, pnfs).
<p>

<h2><a name="assum">
1.0.2 Assumptions and Constraints
</h2>

A constraint is a factor that limits our implementations.
Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, will be considered to be
true, real, or certain.

<menu>

<LI> A usable system must be available in time for vertical slice tests
     in June, 1999.

<LI> The system must be apropos for Run II use, and have a place in the
     overall storage strategy for the laboratory.

<LI> Binaries should be distributed to the users. We should not expect users
     to have to deploy a large infrastructure on their computers to use Enstore.

<LI> The DESY name space is usable for Enstore, available to FNAL, and usable
     for Run II sized applications.

<LI> Fermilab FTT, a platform-independent SCSI tape package is suitable for
     the selected hardware, and useful over Run II projects.

<LI> Tape drives may be attached to user's computers via IP, and an adequate
     IP based network is constructed for Run II.

<LI> A non-transparent interface FMSS-like interface + C API is
     appropriate for the users.

<li> Python is an appropriate choice for implementing the project.  Loadable C
     modules will be used where appropriate, for example, to increase
     performance.

</menu>

--------

Enstore uses a client-server architecture to provide a generic interface for users
to efficiently use mass storage systems.
Enstore supports multiple distributed media robots,
each of which may handle multiple media types or individual directly attached
drives, and multiple distributed mover nodes.
The system architecture does not dictate an exact hardware architecture.
Rather, it specifies a set of general and generic networked hardware
and software components.
These components are loosely coupled in the sense that each one can be
replaced easily without affecting the rest of the system and
each class of components can be easily expanded to accommodate
the increased demand in performance or capacity.
<p>
The system is written in <em>python</em>, a scripting
language that has advanced object-oriented features.
Python provides a sound environment for quick turn-around
and a seamless integration/migration path to
fully compiled languages, such as C and C++, if there is a demand
for even better performance.
<p>
Enstore has four major kinds of software components:
<ul>
<li><em>namespace</em>, implemented by the <em>pnfs</em> package from
        <em>DESY</em>
<li><em>encp</em>, a program used to copy files to and from media libraries
<li><em>servers</em>
        <ul>
        <li>Configuration Server
        <li>Volume Clerk
        <li>File Clerk
        <li>Multiple, distributed Library Managers
        <li>Multiple, distributed Movers
        <li>Media Changer
        <li>Log Server
        <li>Inquisitor
        <li>Alarm Server
        </ul>
<li><em>administration tools</em>
</ul>
These software components, as well as hardware components,
are shown schematically in the following system context diagram.
Hardware components are connected via IP.
Great care has been taken to ensure that the system will function well
under extreme load conditions.
By design, there is no preset limit on the number of concurrent user
computers nor on the number of physical media libraries or drives.
The system is only limited by the availability of physical resources.
We control all of the source code for the system except for that of
<em>pnfs</em> (which is a well supported product from DESY).
<p>
<img src="enstoreSimple.gif">
<p>
<a href="enstoreSimple.ps">(also available in Postscript)</a>
<p>
Enstore does not yet support a disk cache or buffer in front of the media.
However, one is conceivable and planned for a future release.
<p>
Like <em>tcp</em>, the system is architected with distributed and
peer-to-peer reliability.
Each request originating from the <em>encp</em> program is branded
with a unique ID.
<em>Encp</em> retries under well-defined circumstances, issuing
an equivalent request with a new unique ID.
The system can instruct <em>encp</em> to retry if it needs to back out
of an operation.

<h2><a name="pnfs">
1.1 The DESY <em>Pnfs</em> Namespace
</h2>

<em>Pnfs</em> is a DESY written and supported package.  Detailed
information about <em>pnfs</em> can be found on the DESY
<a href=http://mufasa.desy.de/pnfs/Welcome.html>http://mufasa.desy.de/pnfs/Welcome.html</a>
and
<a href=http://watphrakeo.desy.de/pnfs/>http://watphrakeo.desy.de/pnfs/</a>
web pages. The <em>pnfs</em> servers can not be installed without the permission of DESY.
<p>
The DESY <em>pnfs</em> package  implements an <em>nfs-v2</em> daemon and mount daemon.
These daemons do not actually serve a file system, but, instead make a
collection of database entries looks like a file system, and provide
control information for the system. Each file that is created in <em>pnfs</em> has 8
layers that Enstore uses to store metadata information about the file transfers.
Normal UNIX permissions and administered export points
are used to prevent unauthorized access to the name space.
<p>
To inspect files, users mount their portion of the <em>pnfs</em> file
system on their own computers,
and interact with it using the native operating system utilities.
For example, users can <em>ls</em>, <em>stat</em>,
<em>mv</em>, <em>rm</em> or <em>touch</em> existing "files",
but are given errors on attempts to read
or write the content of the files.
Users can also <em>mkdir</em> and <em>rmdir</em>, and <em>ln</em> files. Hard links should be used to ensure all
the metadata information is linked; symbolic links will not give the user what he naively expects.
<p>
There are some special <em>pnfs</em> files can also contain data that administrators can write to and users
can read from, so in that sense <em>pnfs</em> also provides normal files as well,
but these files are the exception rather than the rule.
<p>
Enstore uses <em>pnfs</em> for three different kinds of access and information:
<ol>
<li>Administration Interactions
    <br>
    An administrator can create special files, called wormholes, in the <em>pnfs</em> name space.
    For example, one special file signifies that the system needs to be
    drained (maybe due to an impending shutdown). Existence of this file
    causes <em>encp</em> to stall,
    preventing users from submitting additional jobs and thus draining the Enstore system of transfers.
    The name of the Enstore-draining wormhole file is "local-pnfs-mountpoint/.(config)(flags)/disabled".
    Additional wormholes can be created as needed.
    <p>
<li>Configuration Information
    <br>
    Some creation details
    need to be provided before the user can write files to media. Enstore uses <em>pnfs</em> tag files
    (usually just called tags)for these purposes.
    Tags are are
    associated with a directory and not any specific file.
    Examples of configuration information that is specified with tags include the file family name, file
    family width, Library Manager.
     <p>
<li>User File information
    <br>
    The rest of the system identifies a file by a 64-bit numeric
    identifier, dubbed a "bit file ID".
    After a file is written, the File Clerk generates a bfid and
    <em>encp</em> stores this information
    in one of the <em>pnfs</em> file layers.
    <em>Encp</em> then reads this bit file ID and gives it to the Enstore servers
    when fetching data.
    Other <em>encp</em> file transfer details, such as time of last access or location of
    where the file was copied to or transfer rates, are stored in a different
    metadata layers of the same <em>pnfs</em> file.
</ol>

<h3><a name="ptests">
1.1.2 <em>Pnfs</em> Tests
</h3>
<em>Pnfs</em> was tested in the prototype with very good results. The code was run
on a 200 MHz Pentium Pro Linux machine with SCSI disks.  The <em>pnfs</em> code had
not been run extensively on Linux machines before and there a few minor
glitches were found during initial running. Support from DESY was outstanding
and all problems were solved quickly.

As a test of <em>pnfs'</em> capabilities, the February 1998 set of 250K HPSS filenames
were put into <em>pnfs</em>. Approximately 20 <em>pnfs</em> databases were used for this
test, with each database corresponding to existing HPSS "experimental"
separation. [That is, D0 had its own database, SDSS had its own, and so
forth.] Name lookup was done on each database simultaneously from 3
machines (IRIX, Linux, and AIX) for several days.  <em>Pnfs</em> performed
flawlessly and was able to provide names at a rate of 3-15 names/S. The
database can be further optimized, but this performance is already adequate
for Enstore.
<p>
*** These tests will have to be repeated *** under the final hardware configuration,
but there is not indication of any problems.

<h3><a name="pserver">
1.1.2 <em>Pnfs</em> Server Installation
</h3>

<em>Pnfs</em> Server installation is something an experienced administrator
should do. It is not something that a user should ever have to do.
Further, permission to install <em>pnfs</em> must be granted by the MSS
group at DESY. These requests should be made to
<a href="mailto:patrick@watphrakeo.desy.de">Patrick Furhmann</a> or
<a href="mailto:gasthuber@desy.de">Martin Gasthuber</a> at DESY.

DESY has granted Enstore permission to fully use, but not change, its
<em>pnfs</em> package at Fermilab.  DESY has also granted Enstore the right
to distribute a binary + necessary scripts version of <em>pnfs</em>
(<it>i.e.</it>, no source code) via the normal Fermilab UPD product
distribution mechanism. For example, the current (Jan 99) version in UPD is
<pre>$ upd list pnfs

DATABASE=/ftp/upsdb
        Product=pnfs    Version=v3_1_3a-f4      Flavor=Linux+2
                Qualifiers=""   Chain=current

</pre>

The UPD version can be decoded as follows: "v3_1_3a" is the DESY version of
<em>pnfs</em>, and the "-f4" signifies the 4th Fermi "release". None of the
DESY code is modified - Fermilab only adds its UPS packaging framework and
some local installation instructions. All fixes, changes, or updates to
<em>pnfs</em>, will always come from DESY.

It is expected that there will be only a few <em>pnfs</em> servers at
Fermilab. To date, <em>pnfs</em> servers have been installed on 3 Linux
nodes without any difficulty. Each time, a set of installation instructions
has been improved; however the <em>pnfs</em> server installation is still
not completely automatic.  The Fermilab installation instructions are
distributed along with the UPD product.

On the node that is serving <em>pnfs</em>, <em>pnfs</em> takes over the normal
function of exporting nfs.  Otherwise the machine is general
purpose.  To be explicit, the only 2 processes <em>pnfs</em> server machine can not
run are rpc.mountd and rpc.nfsd. It runs the <em>pnfs</em> versions of these
instead. These processes are only concerned with exporting <em>pnfs</em>.
For example, Rip6 is the current (Jan 99) Enstore <em>pnfs</em>server. Here is its /etc/fstab
<pre>
rip6$ cat /etc/fstab
/dev/sda6               /                       ext2    defaults        1 1
/dev/sda5               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
/dev/sdc1               /rip6a                  ext2    defaults,grpid  2 1
/dev/fd0                /mnt/floppy             ext2    noauto          0 0
none                    /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
rip8:/fnal              /fnal                   nfs     soft,rsize=8192,wsize=8192      0 0
rip8:/home              /home                   nfs     soft,rsize=8192,wsize=8192      0 0
rip8:/usr/local         /usr/local              nfs     soft,rsize=8192,wsize=8192      0 0
localhost:/fs           /pnfs/fs                nfs     noauto,intr,bg,hard,rw,noac       0 0
rip6:/grau-ait          /pnfs/grau/ait          nfs     noauto,user,intr,bg,hard,rw,noac 0 0
rip6:/grau-dlt          /pnfs/grau/dlt          nfs     noauto,user,intr,bg,hard,rw,noac 0 0
rip6:/grau-mammoth      /pnfs/grau/mammoth      nfs     noauto,user,intr,bg,hard,rw,noac 0 0

rip6:/rip6disk1         /pnfs/rip6              nfs     noauto,user,intr,bg,hard,rw,noac 0 0
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, rip6 is nfs mounting 3 disks from rip8 and mounting the
pnfs disks it is exporting as well as the local disks.
There are also numerous Enstore processes running on rip6, for example:

<p>
The main point, often confused, is that the <em>pnfs</em> server node
remains a general purpose and usable machine.
<p>
Permission to mount the <em>pnfs</em> namespace is granted using a
mechanism similar to the normal Unix nfs export permission scheme.  There
are DESY commands (the pmount command) that make this entire process very
simple.
<p>
<em>Pnfs</em> can be started automatically on a boot-up. This allows other nodes to
easily mount the namespaces after reboots.
<p>
Finally, it should be noted that a Run II <em>pnfs</em> server will need is
a SCSI raid level5 disk system for its databases.
<p>
*** Live Backups of database and recovery procedures *** - to be discussed during March trip to
DESY. This has not been a priority yet.

<h3><a name="pclient">
1.1.3 <em>Pnfs</em> Client Installation
</h3>

No <em>pnfs</em> client software is needed -- the <em>pnfs</em> file system
(really namespace) just has to be mounted!  Enstore has been written such
that it recognizes all <em>pnfs</em> namespace if it has a local mounting
point beginning with /pnfs/... . Enstore uses /pnfs as convenient key.

Typical steps for mounting a new <em>pnfs</em> namespace (in this example
the <em>pnfs</em> namespace is called "grau-ait" and it is served from the
rip6 node) are:

<ol>
  <li> As root, mkdir -p /pnfs/grau/ait
  <li> As root, append to /etc/fstab:
       <pre>rip6:/grau-ait /pnfs/grau/ait nfs user,intr,bg,hard,rw,noac 0 0</pre>
       The "intr,bg,hard,rw,noac" mount options should not be changed as they are needed for proper operation.
  <li> mount /pnfs/grau/ait This can be done as a normal user if the "user" mount option
       is specified in the /etc/fstab file.
</ol>
Of course, the actual steps depend on the <em>pnfs</em> installation.
<p>
*** Automounting will be investigated in early Feb 99 *** It is expected to work without
problems. This is deemed especially important since it will streamline the production
farm nodes disk mount administration.
<p>

Finally, it should be noted that mounting <em>the </em>pnfs namespace does
not restrict the node in any other way - it can import and mount any other
file systems and run any tasks as it normally would.

<h3><a name="pcmd">
1.1.4 pcmd: Enstore related <em>pnfs</em> commands
</h3>

All non-I/O Unix commands that operate on normal file systems can also
(typically) be used on the <em>pnfs</em> namespace. DESY has provided
several examples on their web pages and tools in their <em>pnfs</em>
package that allow users to view and control the special features of
<em>pnfs</em>.  Enstore has tailored these tools into a single script,
called pcmd, that allows users to control, manipulate and query pnfs files
that Enstore creates. The pcmd tool is distributed along with the encp
client. It is almost entirely written in shell, and therefore, it is
stand alone and doesn't require any other products, including python.
<p>
Commonly used commands are:
<ul>
   <li>pcmd help        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lists the online help

   <li>pcmd info file   <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lists "important" info about the file *** Needs work to be fully functional ***
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: "eval `pcmd info file`" will set shell variables for the user
	<pre>
	$ pcmd info M1
	bfid="91184924000000L";
	volume="flop309";
	location_cookie="68608";

<h3><a name="volmaps">
1.1.5 <em>Pnfs</em> Volume Maps
</h3>

In order to do request files from a tape in an optimal transversal, it is
necessary for the user to know the order of the files on a tape.  It is expected that an
experiment's catalog will keep this information.  As an additional aid for the user,
<em>encp</em> creates a duplicate file entry in <em>pnfs</em> (in addition to storing
the filename and its metadata).  This duplicate entry is organized by file
families and volumes instead of by the user's directory structure.  The naming
convention for the duplicate entries is such that the file order on the tape
could be readily known.  For example, for sequential files on tape, the name
is just the file number; for files one a disk, it is just the byte
offset. When a user wanted to know what was on a particular tape, he would
just look in the duplicate tree to get the files - then he would read the
necessary information about the linked file from one of the <em>pnfs</em> layers (such
as the bfid, original file name...) to make his transfer request to the mass
storage.

Let's say a user transferred a file to mass storage and called it
/pnfs/enstore/airedale/one.  The file was stored on disk floppy named
"flop301"  with a byte offset=0 and in a file family named "jon".

<pre>
$ ls -alsFt /pnfs/enstore/airedale/one
   0 -rw-rw-r--   1 bakken   root           26 Jul 21 12:09 /pnfs/enstore/airedale/one
</pre>

The duplicate entry is /pnfs/enstore/volmap/jon/flop301/000000000000
In the general case, "jon" would be replaced by the file family name,
"flop301" would become the volume name and "000000000000" would be the file
order on tape.

<pre>
$ ls -alsFt pnfs/enstore/volmap/jon/flop301/000000000000
   0 -rw-r--r--   1 root     root           26 Jul 21 12:09 /pnfs/enstore/volmap/jon/flop301/000000000000
</pre>

The original file and the duplicate file contain cross reference information
to allow the user to get to the other one and enough information to setup a
transfer. An example of this was shown in the previous section in "pcmd info file"

Consider a few cases.
<ul>
<li> If a user wants dozens of files, she can lookup up the volume name where
each file is stored and group her requests so files on one tape are grouped
together.
<li>If a user wants a dozen files from a certain file family but doesn't care
which ones, she can look into the volmap area and pick out files on a specific
volume and set up the request that way.
</ul>

Finally, since the user will not have delete authority to the duplicate
volmap file, this mechanism gives us an automatic trash can facility.  If the
user deletes his entry in <em>pnfs</em>, we still have the duplicate entry and can
"easily" restore the original.


<h2><a name="encp">
1.2 ENCP
</h2>
Reading and writing files means interacting with media.
This is done with an Enstore provided utility, <em>encp</em>.
<em>encp</em> is very similar to the <em>cp</em> command in UNIX.
The syntax is:
<pre>
% encp [options] src_file dst_file
</pre>
Currently there is no wildcarding allowed, but this is a straight forward
extension to <em>encp</em>.

<h3><a name="encp_throttle">
1.2.1 Throttling in <em>encp</em>
</h3>

It is important not to swamp any system.
In Enstore, a first level of throttling is implemented in
<em>encp</em>.
Control communications in Enstore uses a simple reliable
request-response protocol implemented in UDP, whereas data transfers
are implemented using two TCP ports.
A fixed number, currently 30, of pre-allocated TCP ports are
arbitrated among all instances of <em>encp</em> on a given machine.
Consequently, the system will survive the worst sort of abuse,
for example, someone forking off 200 copy requests,
since at most 15 will be active in the system at any time.

<h3><a name="encp_list_from hsm">
1.2.2 Specifying lists of files when reading from or writing to the HSM
</h3>

<em>Encp</em> duplicates unix cp's behaviour when one tries to read or write
multiple input files from the HSM: <br> ecmd encp [options]
source... directory<br> That is, the final item has to be a directory when
specifying an input list.  There is 1 caveat when specifying multiple files
using a single <em>encp</em> command: there is at most 1 mover processing your
request list at a time. If you want more than mover active, you should use
multiple <em>encp</em> commands when you are reading lists of files from more than
one volume.  The reason <em>encp</em> uses just one mover is to keep the system
simple (if you want to use multiple movers, then use many <em>encp</em>
commands).
<p>

On reads from the HSM, <em>encp</em> scans all your files and groups them according
to which volume they are on and then submits all the file requests that are
on one specific volume, reads all the files for that volume from the hsm
and then proceeds to the next volume.  <em>Encp</em> processes the volumes in any
order it chooses.
<p>

On writes to the HSM, <em>encp</em> processes each input file sequentially. Since
the user must specify a single output directory, all input files belong to
the same file family, and hence could all go to the same tape (if
possible). <em>Encp</em> sets a flag,"don't dismount the volume too quickly -
there's more files coming for the same family", that the mover uses to
postpone the dismount and thereby bypass the extra times involved in the
volume manipulations.  Please note that there is no guarantee that all the
files will go to one tape (there might not be room) or that they will be
grouped together on the tape (there may be other writes to the same family
that get intermixed).
<p>

Consider the following example (P=/pnfs/enstore/airedale) for reading from
the HSM:
<p>

There are the following files on flop301: ran-1, ran-2 ran-3, ran-4<br>
There are the following files on flop302: ran-5, ran-6 ran-7, ran-8<br>
There are the following files on flop302: ran-9, ran-10 ran-11, ran-12<br>
<p>

<em>Encp</em> submits the requests for all files on flop301 and reads back those
files and then does the same for flop302 and flop303.
<p>

Here is the output of an actual test:
<pre>
$ ecmd encp $P/ran-1       $P/ran-2        $P/ran-3        $P/ran-4 \

<h2><a name="servers">
1.3 Enstore servers
</h2>

Enstore servers are software entities which handle media, and in a
future release, disk caches.
The high level  concepts are as follows:
<dl>
<dt><em>Physical library</em>
<dd>Physical Library represents a real, tangible collection of media
along with software drivers/utilities to manipulate, read and write
and organize them.

A physical library can be thought of as consisting of
<ul>
        <li>one or more virtual libraries
        <li>a media changer
        <li>one of more media export/import slots
        <li>one of more drives (tape, cdrom, disk, etc.)
        <li>volumes (tape cartridges, cdroms, etc.)
</ul>
<p>
<em>Virtual Library</em> -- A virtual library contains one and only one
kind of media.
For example, Enstore divides an STK powderhorn
library holding 50, 20 and 10 GB redwood media into at least three
virtual libraries.  In common usage, the term "library" in Enstore
refers to a virtual library. Writes are directed to a specific (virtual)
library, thus selecting the media.
<p>
<em>Drives</em> -- Drives are bound to special processes called Mover
clients.
The drives can be dynamically assigned allowing the number of drives
to be less than the number of virtual libraries.
<p>
<em>Volumes</em> -- Are uniquely identified by an external label,
which is known to the Media Changer.
<p>
<dt><em>Quota Family</em>
<dd>A quota family is a set of pairs of media names and maximum number of volumes.
All files are created with respect to a quota family.
Creation of a file is not allowed if the maximum number of volumes
in that family would be exceeded.
<p>
<dt><em>File family</em>:
<dd>A file family is specified by a name and an integer "width".
A file family is associated with every file creation.
Within a given library, Enstore keeps no more
than <em>"width"</em> volumes open for writing, and loads volumes on
no more than <em>"width"</em>
number of drives at any given moment.
This is not striping, but rather, the number of different volumes,
and hence different files, which can be active at one time.
Once a volume is associated with a file family, only files in that
family will be placed on the volume.
By design, there is no pre-set limit on the number of file families.
Clever use of file families will allow volumes to be faulted out to
"shelf", and also to decrease access times for subsequent reads.  When a file
family has filled all of its "width" media, new media, limited by a quota,
are drawn out of a pool of blanks.
</dl>
Media ejected to shelf are put into a shelf virtual library and
are controlled by a shelf Library Manager.
Users are informed that this data is currently unavailable, and if
they really want the data, arrangements should be made to have the
media placed in a library which is accessible,
or get it manually later.
<p>
<h3><a name="volume_clerk">

<p>
The File Clerk supports the following requests:
<ul>
<li>show bfid of all the files
<li>show file information
<li>start/stop backup of file journals
<li>assist in processing file read requests
</ul>

<h3><a name="library_manager">
1.3.3 Library Manager
</h3>
The Library Manager is a server which queues up and dispatches work for
a virtual library. There is one Library Manager for each virtual library.
It has three types of clients
<ol>
<li><em>Users</em> -- seeking to have their files read or written files.
<li><em>Movers</em> -- seeking to actually read or write files.
<li><em>Publishers</em> -- seeking HTML describing the library's current work.
</ol>
<h3><a name="user_request">
1.3.3.1 Users' Requests
</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Writes into the system
<dd>Based on the user's mss destination filename, a <em>pnfs</em> tag
associated with the destination directory, identifies
    the library for a write request allowing the <em>encp</em> program to compose
    a write request and contact the appropriate Library Manager
    directly.
    The Library Manager queues the work, and acknowledges the request.

<dt>Read from the system
<dd>Given the fact that users may mv the <em>pnfs</em> files, on reads from the system,
     <em>pnfs</em> can only provide the bit
    file ID associated with the file. In this case, <em>encp</em> contacts the
     bit File Clerk, and that
    software ultimately contacts the appropriate Library Manager to
    queue up the work.
</dl>
Work can be prioritized.
Larger priority numbers means higher priority.
Currently, write and read are both priority 1 for our test purposes.
Any priority mechanism should be able to be developed.
However, the system will exhaust all work for a volume,
given that it has been mounted, regardless of priority.
<p>
<h3><a name="mover_request">
1.3.3.2 Movers' Requests
</h3>
Movers seek to transport data between media and users over a TCP socket.
Movers contact Library Managers seeking work. If the Library Manager
has work, the Mover is requested to mount a volume, and report
back. When reporting back, the Mover may be told to contact a waiting
<em>encp</em> program and read or write a file.
The Mover may be told to unmount a volume as there is no more work for
the volume.
A Mover may have dismounted a volume unilaterally because it ran into
trouble.  This is summarized in the tables below
<table>
<td><b>Mover sends</b>
<td><b>Library Manager may respond</b>
<tr>
<td valign=top>idle_mover
<td>if work needs to be done - bind a volume; <br>or if no work - just acknowledge
<tr>
<td valign=top>have_bound_volume
<td>if reads/writes pending for the volume - read/write;  <br>or if no work - unbind volume
<tr>
<td>unilateral_unbind
<td>just acknowledge
</table>

<table>
<td valign=top><b>Library has just responded</b>
<td valign=top><b>Mover sends</b>
<td valign=top><b>Library Manager presumes</b>
<tr>
<td valign=top>bind or...<br>read or...<br>write
<td valign=top>idle_mover
<td valign=top>Mover crashed and was re-started
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<td valign=top>have_bound_volume
<td valign=top>look for work on that volume<br>
    if work, give it<br>
    if none, give unbind volume
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<td valign=top>unilateral_unbind
<td valign=top>take any work reserved for that Mover and put it back
   in the unassigned work queue
<tr>
<td valign=top>acknowledged a...<br>unilateral unbind or..<br>idle Mover
<td valign=top>idle_mover
<td valign=top>Mover is available for work, If more work available, bind a
    volume
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<td valign=top>have_bound_volume
<td valign=top>it has restarted, the Mover had a volume from a previous
    instance of me, tell it to unbind
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<td valign=top>Unilateral_unbind
<td valign=top>Just acknowledge
</table>

Note that if a Mover should crash holding a volume, the worst that can
happen is that the Library Manager will be unable to schedule work for
that volume. If the physical library has more than one drive, the system
should be able to continue servicing requests.
<p>
<h3><a name="pub_request">
1.3.3.3 Publisher Requests
</h3>
It is possible to query the Library Manager and get information about its
internal queues thereby knowing where work is.  The prototype has a
rudimentary implementation of this feature. More work needs to be done before
this can be considered functional.

<h3><a name="mover">
1.3.4 Mover
</h3>
A Mover task is bound to a single drive, and seeks to use that drive to service
read and write requests.  It communicates with the Library Manager in a
defined protocol, as just described.
<p>
The Mover is responsible for efficient data movement and as such is an
integral part of the system.  The architecture allows for performance critical
code to be written in "C" thus allowing efficient access to fundamental OS
features such as forking with minimal to no language overhead.
<p>
Although a Mover is bound to a drive, and a drive may serve more than one
virtual library, i.e., the Mover has a dynamic list of of Library Managers
that it is supposed to service.  This has two benefits.
First, since a Library Manager handles only one type of media, a drive which
handles multiple types of media (i.e. different capacity media) can be shared
without a static partitioning of the system.
Second, if we are partitioning resources in a library, we can assign a Library
Manager to each type of use.  For example, suppose Group A and Group B want to share
the capacity of a library.
Suppose half the tapes belong to Group A  and the half to Group B. We want to guarantee that
Group A have one third of the tape drives, Group B have one third, and the last third
be shared.  The Movers can be configured to do this easily.  And with some slight
changes, this is how we can guarantee resources to data acquisition.
<p>
The Mover hunts Library Managers that have work when it is idle by
consulting a Configuration Server.
A Mover's configuration gives a list of Library Managers to hunt among
for work.
If there is no work at any Library Manager,
the Mover sleeps for a while and begins the hunt again.
While sleeping the Mover is sensitive to datagrams at a
specific UDP address. A Library Manager uses this mechanism to try to
hasten a Mover when the Library Manager has work queued up.
<p>
When a Mover has found a Library Manager that has work, it attempts
to mount the salient volume, by contacting the physical library's Media
Changer.  If there is some error, it issues a unilateral unbind to the
Library Manager. If all is well, it issues a have_bound_volume to the
Library Manager.
<p>
Reads -- Once a volume is bound the Mover may read a volume and send data
to a waiting <em>encp</em> program. Two tcp ports are involved.
        The steps are:
<ol>
<li>Arbitrate for a TCP port for the data transfer.
<li>Open the tcp port (control port) specified in the request,
    send the <em>encp</em> program the data transfer port address,
    hold the control port open. If it is dropped, abort.
<li>Read the data from a volume, (stripping any wrapper like tar headers)
    verify the sanity crc. send the data to the user.
<li>Close the data port.
<li>Tell the user done and all is well.
</ol>

If any errors occur while reading the volume, an attempt is made to
characterize them as either media or drive.  This is discussed more completely
in the section on Error control.
<p>
Writes -- Once a volume is bound the Mover may receive data and write it to
the volume. Two tcp ports are involved.
        The steps are:
<ol>
<li>Arbitrate for a TCP port for the data transfer.
<li>Open the tcp port (control port) specified in the request,
    send the <em>encp</em> program the data transfer port address,
    hold the control port open. If it is dropped, abort.
<li>Mark the volume as "writing". That will cause the volume to
    not be selected for subsequent writes, should we crash.
<li>Using the eod_space_cookie, space to end of volume. Try
    to verify that we are actually at the end of volume.
<li>Receive data from <em>encp</em>, wrapper it, and write it to the volume
<li>Close the data port.
<li>Compute new eod_cookie and tell Volume Clerk that the
    volume is writable. Update remaining bytes as well.
<li>Compute the file location cookie, and tell the bit
    File Clerk about the new file. Get a bit file ID in return.
<li>Give the bit file ID to <em>encp</em>. We are done.
</ol>

If any errors occur while writing the volume, an attempt is made to
characterize
them as either media or drive.  This is discussed more completely in the
section on Error control.  If the user drops the control tcp
channel unilaterally, assume he has aborted.
<p>
<h3><a name="config_server">
1.3.5 Configuration Server
</h3>
The Configuration Server maintains the crucial information about
system configuration, such as the location and parameters of each server.
The first thing that each server does when it starts up is to
ask the Configuration Server for information (e.g. the location
of any other server with which to communicate).  New configurations can be
loaded into the Configuration Server without disturbing the current running
system.
<h3><a name="log_server">
1.3.6 Log Server
</h3>
The Log Server receives messages from other processes and logs them into
formatted log files.
Basically, these messages are transactional records.
Log files are labeled by dates.
At midnight each day, the currently opened log file gets closed and another
one is opened.
<p>
Additionally it is expected that a trace module will be developed.
<h3><a name="media_changer">
1.3.7 Media Changer
</h3>
The Media Changer mounts and dismounts the media into and from the drive
according to a request from the Mover.  One Media Changer can serve multiple
drives and libraries.  When the drives are in the robot, the Media Changer
is the interface to the robotic software.
<h3><a name="inquisitor">
1.3.8 Inquisitor
</h3>
The Inquisitor obtains information from the Enstore system and creates the 
following reports using this information:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>an <a href="#inquisitor_ascii_status">ascii file</a> continuously recording the Enstore system status
<LI>an <a href="#inquisitor_html_status">html file</a> recording the latest status snapshot of the Enstore system
<LI>an <a href="#inquisitor_encp_status">html file</a> recording a snapshot of a history of encp commands 
<LI>a <a href="#inquisitor_plot_ita">plot of individual transfer activity</a>
<LI>a <a href="#inquisitor_plot_btd">plot of total bytes transferred/day</a>
</UL>

The reports are updated periodically based on 
<a href="#inquisitor_config">timeout values</a> in the Enstore
config file directing the Inquisitor to gather
each servers' information on a specific frequency.  Each Enstore server may have
its own unique timeout value specified for it.  For example, the Inquisitor
may be instructed to gather information from the file_clerk every 60 seconds but
from the log_server every 135 seconds.  However the plots are not updated
automatically and may be updated by a user initiated command or by a cron job
for example.  This information is obtained from the log files.
<p>
The inquisitor will listen for command
line requests sent to it and will periodically check to see if it is time to
update information for any of the servers that it is monitoring.  If so, then the
server in question is contacted and the resulting information is formated for
output to the various reports. The possible information gathered from each of the
servers and which report it ends up in are listed below.  In addition to
gathering information of each Enstore server, the Inquisitor will collect
information from the log files on encp commands and report on the blocksizes
set in the Enstore config file.

Since the Inquisitor can request a new config file from the config_server 
periodically, it is possible to dynamically change the way information is

<P>
In addition to the information listed above, the inquisitor will look for the
<B>inq_timeout</B> dictionary element in each of the individual server sections.
If present, the value of this dictionary element will be used to specify the 
timeout value for monitoring this server.  This is the same as if the 
<B>timeouts</B>  dictionary element mentioned
above contained a dictionary element for the particular server.  For example, 
in order to monitor the file_clerk every 65 seconds, the Enstore config file 
must have one of the following in it:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>in the inquisitor section - a dictionary element, within the <B>timeouts</B>
dictionary element, for the file clerk set to 65
<LI>in the file_clerk section - the dictionary element <B>inq_timeout</B> set to
65
</UL>
The value in the individual server dictionary element will take precedence over
the value in the Inquisitor dictionary element.
<P>
In order to block monitoring of a particular server, set it's timeout value to 
-1.

An example Inquisitor dictionary element is given below:<BR>

2 Databases in Enstore
</h2>
The database used in Enstore must provide the following:
<ul>
<li>
Support journaling of the database to record all changes and support full
     database recovery.
<li>
Support database check-pointing in order to enable full database recovery.
<li>
Support performing daily backups of the database, log, and journal files.
<li>
Support recovery of corrupted databases using the journal or log files.
<li>
Support "python dictionary" interface.
</ul>

<h2><a name="backup_recovery">
2.1 Backup and Recovery Procedures
</h2>
<h3><a name="backup">
2.1.1 Backup
</h3>
The backup procedure is a cron job that is performed routinely. It copies
the database files, log files and journal files to a designated
directory on a remote host. Two environment variables should be set
up for this purpose: ENSTORE_BCKP_HST (default="localhost") and
ENSTORE_DB_BACKUP (default="tmp/backup"). The backup procedure will
perform the following actions:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign=top>Libtp database
<td valign=top><ul>

</table>
<h3><a name="recovery">
2.2.2 Recovery

Recovery should be a job initiated manually in case of database corruption.
There are two ways to recover from a crash:
<p>
<table>

<td valign=top>libtp utility
<td valign=top><ul>
<li>copy database tar file in designated directory, untar the file
<li>copy the latest log file from $ENSTORE_DB,

</ul>
<tr>

<li>move the resulting database files to $ENSTORE_DB
</ul>
</table>

<h3><a name="current_db">
2.2 Current Underlying Database Implemented in Enstore
</h3>

The current Enstore implementation uses LIBTP (BSD DB v2.3) as the underlying
database product.
LIBTP is free for non-profit organizations like Fermilab, and has the
following features:

<ul>
<li>
one key dictionary-like database. It is designed to
store/retrieve binary large objects (BLOBs) of arbitrary length, by text key.
<li>
ability to store data items of unlimited size
<li>
support for various data storage structures: hash table, binary tree,
numbered records
<li>
allows duplicate keys (Enstore doesn't use them)
<li>
data scanning with cursors, multiple cursors may be opened at the same time
<li>
different levels of cursor stability
<li>
transactions
<li>
transaction logging
<li>
check-pointing
<li>
backup and recovery tools
<li>
custom locks
<li>
deadlock detection
</ul>


A LIBTP-Python shelve-like interface was developed. It provides access to:
<ul>
<li>All three data structures: hash table, binary tree, numbered records
<li>Cursors
<li>Transactions
<li>Locks
</ul>

LIBTP was chosen based on the following considerations:

<ul>
<li>
Nimbleness to allow us to set up test stands while developing and not being encumbered by
     database licensing issues.
<li>
It is similar to dbm-like databases used for the initial Enstore design.
This made it easy to develop a Python interface for it and any necessary
changes to the Enstore code were localized and relatively easy to make.
<li>
Database maintenance is relatively inexpensive. It requires only two
processes to run. One for check-pointing and the other for deadlock detection.
<li>
It is simple and fast enough.
<li>
It provides tools for database transaction logging, database backup and
recovery.
<li>
It is readily obtainable and free.
</ul>

We don't consider the current selection of the LIBTP database to be
necessarily the final one.  For example, although it may not be necessary
for Enstore's internal needs, implementation of maintenance functionality
is not realistically possible without a way to select data using attributes
other than the primary database key. There are two possible ways to solve
this problem. One way is to create additional database index tables. This
is a straightforward extension on top of LIBTP, although probably not the
most elegant solution. Another possible method we are considering is to use
relational databases in Enstore.  For the Enstore project, databases are a
modular component and switching databases means modifying a module only. If
a new database is chosen, we are expecting that the database servers and
clients will have to be redesigned to take advantage of the relational
features.  Python interfaces will also have to be developed to allow the
current framework to keep working.

<h2><a name="admin_tools">
2.3 Administrative Tools
</h2>

Administrative tools will provide the following operations:
<ul>
<li>Display all volumes for a specified media
<li>List all the files and their location on a single or set of media
<li>List file/files on the media by creation date
<li>List all the media that belongs to a specified file family
<li>List files that belongs to a specified file family
<li>Display the date of the last mount for a specified volume
<li>List all media belonging to a file family sorted by the most recent media
mount date
<li>List all media belonging to a file family where the last access date is
before a specified date
<li>Export meta-data of ejected media into a flat file
<li>Import meta-data from a flat file when importing the media from outside the
Enstore system
<li>List all files/volumes that belong to user/group
<li>Mark the volume as readonly if all of the files on the media are older
than a specified date
<li> Delete specified files in the <em>pnfs</em> trashbin.
<li>Find and recycle volumes where all files have been deleted.
<li>Check for files known to the File Clerk but unknown to <em>pnfs</em>
</ul>

<h2><a name="protocol">
3 Communication Protocols
</h2>
The base protocol for Enstore is UDP for "brief" messages and TCP for data
transfers.

UDP message sizes are all less than size of maximum UDP packet size so the
protocol is very simple.

<p>
The base server protocol is the same for all servers.  State-fullness is
minimized, not eliminated.
<p>
Each transmission has a unique ID, timeout and maximum number of retries
associated with it.  The timeout allows for debugging.
For each reception, the "message" is checked against messages received to see
if the reception is a repeat. If the reception is a *repeat request*, send a
saved copy of the response; if the reception is *repeat response*, just
ignored it. This will take care of the case when a timeout/retry happens just
before a response is received.

4.3 Detailed Error Discussion
</h3>

<P>Much of the system state is stored within the user's <em>encp</em> client.
This allows the <em>encp</em> client to retry on a large number of different
errors. This retry is given a very high priority when it is received
by the Library Manager so the user doesn't have to wait again for
their job. It is the Library Manager's responsibility to ensure the
error is not just repeated; for example, on a volume read error, the
volume should not go to the same drive on a retry. The Library
Manager gets the retry, volume and drive information from the ticket.</P>

<P>Many interesting errors are related to cases where the volume
cannot be written or read, or when it is suspected that volume is
jammed, etc. More experience is needed with the actual hardware
before the correct error control behavior is established. In the
interim, Enstore will make the following working assumptions: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>If there is trouble during a load or unload operation, the
	volume is assumed to be physically jammed. No operations on the
	drive or the volume until an administrator looks at the problem. 
	<LI>If several drives have fatal write errors on a volume, the
	volume will be marked read only. 
	<LI>If several drives have fatal read errors on a volume, the volume
	will be marked no access. 
	<LI><P>If a drive has several fatal errors on different volumes, the
	drive will be marked offline.</P>
</UL>
