Origins</H2>
Enstore was originally written in Python under Linux using disk files to
simulate tape drives. It ported easily to&nbsp; IRIX and AIX .&nbsp; Next,
it was extended with a C module named ETape that&nbsp; calls FTT (Fermi
Tape Tools).&nbsp;&nbsp; FTT is used to obtain the information about space
remaining on tape cartridges and errors encountered while accessing tapes.&nbsp;
This phase required a more extensive test environment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Test Stand</H2>
The test stand that evolved contained different operating systems, different
network connections, and different kinds of tape drives.&nbsp; The <A HREF="test-stand.ps">test
stand schematic</A> shows the layout.

<P>Some of the interesting points in the test stand:
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
A 20MB/sec fibre channel network connection between two AIX nodes.</LI>

<LI>
A 56KB/sec to a Linux PC</LI>

<LI>
Two Storage Tek Redwood tape drives (12MB/sec)</LI>

<LI>
A Storage Tek 4410 silo and robot</LI>

<LI>
Exabyte 8500 tape drives</LI>

<LI>
Enstore library managers and movers running on Linux, Irix and AIX platforms</LI>

<H2>
Test Results</H2>
The most significant test results were obtained using the two AIX machines
with
<BR>fibre channel connection and the Redwood tape drives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enstore
repeatedly wrote
<BR>eight cartridges (50GB each) or 400 GB of random data in in approximately
60 hours.
<BR>Eight cartridges was the number available for the test and there is
no reason to
<BR>believe&nbsp; enstore could not have continued.

<P>The test was run with a mover on fntt2, a RS6000/F50-a fast modern machine,&nbsp;
writing to a Redwood tape drive and encp on fntt1, a RS6000/370 -a slow(circa
1992) machine
<BR>reading from old disk drives.&nbsp; During this test the data rates
were limited by&nbsp; the memory FNTT1 which was paging during the transfer.

<P>The test was also run entirely on fntt2&nbsp; i.e. over a local tcp/ip
connect not over an external network.&nbsp;&nbsp; During this test the
limit was the speed of the disk from which
<BR>encp was reading

Test Summary</H3>

In the above table the&nbsp; DATA&nbsp;XFR TIME and ATE are the times to
transfer
<BR>the data not including tape mount times (~50sec).&nbsp; The TOTAL&nbsp;TIME
and RATE
<BR>is from the start of encp until it is notified the data is on tape.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Logs of the <A HREF="redwoodfiber.log">network</A>
<BR><A HREF="redwoodfiber.log">transfer </A>and the <A HREF="redwoodlocal.log">local
transfer</A> show all of the detail.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
What Was Not Tested</H2>
Error conditions did not occur during testing of the prototype.&nbsp; Tape
and network
<BR>errors are known to cause file transfers to fail and not be retried.&nbsp;
These errors and many others must be handled in a production system but
the prototype did run continuously for days&nbsp; with out error conditions.
