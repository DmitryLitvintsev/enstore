1. If you are running enstore on a node that it has never been run on before,
you need to create an hsm lock directory and lock file: client_node_install in
the enstore bin area will do this for you.

2. You also need pnfs to be available and mounted on the machine you are
trying to run on.  This requires adding your node to the pnfs export list on
the pnfs server node.  See bakken if you want to add a node to pnfs exporting.

To mount a minimal pnfs, create a mount point (/pnfs/enstore by default) and
use the $ENSTORE/bin/pnfs-mount command, which does a mount -nfs ... similar
to:

        irix-options="hard,intr,rw,noac"
        options="hard,intr,rw"
    mount -o $options pcfarm4:/enstore  /pnfs/enstore

3. If you've checked out enstore:
        a. cd to the main enstore directory
        b. setup -r `pwd` enstore
