abstract: We report on the design and status of an implementation of a high
speed distributed data storage system which will meet the data collection and
access requirements of Fermilab experiments for the next collider
run. Enstore's architecture is based on the DESY OSM model. Software
components include the PNFS system from DESY, Fermilab software libraries
already widely used in existing storage and tape facilities, and new software
to provide the further functionality needed by CDF and D0. The system will
support acquisition of data from the experiment date acquisition systems of
20-50 Mbytes/sec as well as data transfer for reconstruction and analysis, to
provide aggregate transfer rates of up to 200 Mbytes/sec to a storage system
of more than 1 PB. A prototype of the Enstore has been written and the
feasibility of the approach demonstrated. Enstore supports a system of
multiple, distributed tape robots; multiple media types of robotic or directly
connected commodity tape drives; distribution of the data mover functions
across commodity computers; as well as providing control and flexibility for
priority access to the tapes; system reconfiguration without disruption of
operations; and management of the movement of tapes between the robot and less
accessible shelf storage. The prototype, started in January and in test by
April with about 10 Man months of effort, reads and writes tapes for periods
of a day over a distributed system of PC and IBM server and client nodes.
