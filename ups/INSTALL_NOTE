NOTICE:

This product contains a setuid executable bin/ftt_suid, which needs to
be installed setuid to root on most platforms.  If you install this
product as root, it should unpack that way, but if you install it as
some other user, or in AFS space,  you will probably need to have a
system administrator set the permissions on the executable.

If you are on a system where this is not possible, simply replace
the ftt_suid executable with a copy of /bin/true, to keep it from
issuing error messages, and (while you lose some functionality like
statistics, etc.) basic tape input/output will work.
