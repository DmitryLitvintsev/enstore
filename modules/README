Each .c file in this modules directory must be a python module -
see one of the existing modules.   

The file name base, e.g. ETape, is the module name.   In python
you say "import ETape".   ETape.c has one externalized entry point
initETape which does module initialization for python.

ETape.exp contains "initETape" - this is for the AIX loader.

The PYTHONINC file is the location of python.h.  python.h includes
config.h.  Python 1.5's make install copies config.h to the
instll's include directory but Python 1.4 does not and you need to
do something.

PYTHONMOD is the location is the location of python.exp which is a list 
of all of the entry points in python and is used in the AIX ld.

Makefile is copied from a generic makefile in the oracledb module.
It uses the results of the configure step in the python build
so it is prtable.


To use dbx with modules

setenv CC "cc -c" and make

window 1                      window 2

python
import ETape        
                              dbx -p <pid of python process>
                              use <source dir>
                              file ETape.c
                              stop in in ET_CopyToTape
                              cont
ETape.CopyToTape()
                              process stops in dbx



To use gdb with modules (basically the same, except):
Note: need at least v4.17 of gdb

window 1                       window 2
------------                   ---------------

			       gdb python_path/python pid
