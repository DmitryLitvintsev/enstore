# Alan Conway to users@qpid.apache.org on 9/12/11 :
# The logger does a substring match of the --log-enable string against the fully-qualied name of the c++ function with the logging statement. 
# So e.g. --log-enable debug+:cluster matches everything in the qpid::cluster module (which by convention is in the qpid/cluster src directory.) 
# Usually it's used to identify a general areas like broker, messaging, cluster etc. but if you care to read the source you can target individual functions.
