-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To obtain help with the installation or use of ftt, please send mail to 

                ftt_support@fnal.fnal.gov

which is auto-forwarded to the group in charge of juke support at Fermilab.

This software is furnished by Fermilab on an "as is" basis as a service
to the wider community with the goal of stimulating collaborative use and
further development.  

Provision of the software implies no commitment of support by Fermilab.

The Fermilab Computing Division is open to discussing other levels of 
support for use of the software with responsible and committed users and
collaborators.

Use of the software in experiments at Fermilab will be assured of a level 
of support as agreed to through the standard Memorandum Of Understanding
process.

Users may send mail to the mail address given above, with the expectation 
that it will be read and noted.
