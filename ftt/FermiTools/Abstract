Abstract

The "ftt" product is a library of software to allow platform and device
independant tape I/O with a full feature set, including collection of
tape statistics.  A command line interface is also provided for doing 
tape drive testing, and other work.  The SCSI pass-through code that
is provided as part of "ftt" is also used by other FermiTools packages,
such as "juke".  The package includes a Users Guide, Design Notes, and
Porting Guide, which are all FrameMaker documents provided in the
"doc" directory of the product.

The product currently supports Exabyte model 8200, 8500, and 8505
tape drives, DLT 2000 and 4000 series tape drives, used on
AIX 3.2, AIX 4.1, IRIX 5.3, SunOS 5.4 (a.k.a Solaris 2.4), and
